The model represents a family of relationships that relate the input (age of child) to the output (height of child). The particular relationship is chosen using training data, which consists of input/output pairs (orange points). When we train the model, we search through the possible re- lationships for one that describes the data well. Here, the trained model is the cyan curve and can be used to compute the height for any age. order is important; my wife ate the chicken is not the same as the chicken ate my wife. The text must be encoded into numerical form before passing it to the model. Here, we use a fixed vocabulary of size 10,000 and simply concatenate the word indices. For the music classification example, the input vector might be of fixed size (perhaps a 10-second clip) but is very high-dimensional. Digital audio is usually sampled at 44.1 kHz and represented by 16-bit integers, so a ten-second clip consists of 441, 000 integers. Clearly, supervised learning models will have to be able to process sizeable inputs. The input in the image classification example (which consists of the concatenated RGB values at every pixel) is also enormous. Moreover, its structure is naturally two-dimensional; two pixels above and below one another are closely related, even if they are not adjacent in the input vector. Finally, consider the input for the model that predicts the melting and boiling points of the molecule. A molecule may contain varying numbers of atoms that can be connected in different ways. In this case, the model must ingest both the geometric structure of the molecule and the constituent atoms to the model.\n",

Consider a model to predict the height of a child from their age (figure 1.3). The machine learning This work is subject to a Creative Commons CC-BY-NC-ND license. (C) MIT Press. 1.1 Supervised learning 5 model is a mathematical equation that describes how the average height varies as a function of age (cyan curve in figure 1.3). When we run the age through this equation, it returns the height. For example, if the age is 10 years, then we predict that the height will be 139 cm. More precisely, the model represents a family of equations mapping the input to the output (i.e., a family of different cyan curves). The particular equation (curve) is chosen using training data (examples of input/output pairs). In figure 1.3, these pairs are represented by the orange points, and we can see that the model (cyan line) describes these data reasonably. When we talk about training or fitting a model, we mean that we search through the family of possible equations (possible cyan curves) relating input to output to find the one that describes the training data most accurately. It follows that the models in figure 1.2 require labeled input/output pairs for training. For example, the music classification model would require a large number of audio clips where a human expert had identified the genre of each. These input/output pairs take the role of a teacher or supervisor for the training process, and this gives rise to the term supervised learning.\n",

They can output single real numbers (regression), multiple numbers (multivariate regression), or probabilities over two or more classes (binary and multiclass classification, respectively). As we shall see in the next section, their outputs may also be very large, of variable length, and contain internal structure.

Figure 1.4e depicts a very challenging task in which the input is descriptive text, and the model must produce an image that matches this description. In principle, the latter three tasks can be tackled in the standard supervised learning framework, but they are more diﬀicult for two reasons. First, the output may genuinely be ambiguous; there are multiple valid translations from an English sentence to a French one and multiple images that are compatible with any caption. Second, the output contains considerable structure; not all strings of words make valid English and French sentences, and not all collections of RGB values make plausible images. In addition to learning the mapping, we also have to respect the “grammar” of the output. Fortunately, this “grammar” can be learned without the need for output labels. For example, we can learn how to form valid English sentences by learning the statistics of a large corpus of text data.

Others merely learn a mechanism to generate new examples without explicitly describing their distribution. State-of-the-art generative models can synthesize examples that are extremely plau- sible but distinct from the training examples. They have been particularly successful at generating images (figure 1.5) and text (figure 1.6). They can also synthesize data under the constraint that some outputs are predetermined (termed conditional genera- tion). Examples include image inpainting (figure 1.7) and text completion (figure 1.8). Indeed, modern generative models for text are so powerful that they can appear intel- ligent. Given a body of text followed by a question, the model can often “fill in” the missing answer by generating the most likely completion of the document. However, in reality, the model only knows about the statistics of language and does not understand the significance of its answers.

I had left in such a hurry that I had not thought to pack any food, and I had not thought to bring a weapon. I was unarmed and alone in a strange place, and I did not know what I was doing.

It seemed like there were hundreds of students and they looked intimidating. I stepped up to the lectern and was about to speak when something bizarre happened. Suddenly, the room was filled with a deafening noise, like a giant roar. It was so loud that I couldn’t hear anything else and I had to cover my ears. I could see the students looking around, con- fused and frightened. Then, as quickly as it had started, the noise stopped and the room was silent again. I stood there for a few moments, trying to make sense of what had just happened. Then I realized that the students were all staring at me, waiting for me to say something. I tried to think of something witty or clever to say, but my mind was blank. So I just said, “Well, that was strange,’ and then I started my lecture. Figure 1.8 Conditional text synthesis.

For example, the num- ber of valid and meaningful English sentences is considerably smaller than the number of strings created by drawing words at random. Similarly, real-world images are a tiny subset of the images that can be created by drawing random RGB values for every pixel. This is because images are generated by physical processes (see figure 1.9). This leads to the idea that we can describe each data example using a smaller number of underlying latent variables. Here, the role of deep learning is to describe the mapping between these latent variables and the data.

Many generative models use a deep learning model to describe the relationship between a low-dimensional “latent” variable and the observed high-dimensional data. The latent variables have a simple probability distribution by design. Hence, new examples can be generated by sampling from the simple distribution over the latent variables and then using the deep learning model to map the sample to the observed data space. Figure 1.11 Image interpolation. In each row the left and right images are real and the three images in between represent a sequence of interpolations created by a generative model. The generative models that underpin these interpolations have learned that all images can be created by a set of underlying latent variables. By finding these variables for the two real images, interpolating their values, and then using these intermediate variables to create new images, we can generate intermediate results that are both visually plausible and mix the characteristics of the two original images.

By sampling from this distribution and passing the result through the deep learning model, we can create new samples (figure 1.10). These models lead to new methods for manipulating real data. For example, consider finding the latent variables that underpin two real examples. We can interpolate between these examples by interpolating between their latent representations and mapping the intermediate positions back into the data space (figure 1.11).\n",

For example, consider learning to predict the images corresponding to a caption. Rather than directly map the text input to an image, we can learn a relation between latent variables that explain the text and the latent variables that explain the image. This has three advantages. First, we may need fewer text/image pairs to learn this mapping now that the inputs and outputs are lower dimensional. Second, we are more likely to generate a plausible-looking image; any sensible values of the latent variables should produce something that looks like a plausible example. Third, if we introduce randomness to either the mapping between the two sets of latent variables or the mapping from the latent variables to the image, then we can generate multiple images that are all described well by the caption (figure 1.12).\n",

      "│   │       └──  Consider teaching a humanoid robot to locomote. The robot can perform a limited number of actions at a given time (moving various joints), and these change the state of the world (its pose). We might reward the robot for reaching checkpoints in an obstacle course. To reach each checkpoint, it must perform many actions, and it’s unclear which ones contributed to the reward when it is received and which were irrelevant. This is an example of the temporal credit assignment problem. A second example is learning to play chess. Again, the agent has a set of valid actions (chess moves) at any given time. However, these actions change the state of the system in a non-deterministic way; for any choice of action, the opposing player might respond with many different moves. Here, we might set up a reward structure based on capturing pieces or just have a single reward at the end of the game for winning. In the latter case, the temporal credit assignment problem is extreme; the system must learn which of the many moves it made were instrumental to success or failure. The exploration-exploitation trade-off is also apparent in these two examples. The robot may have discovered that it can make progress by lying on its side and pushing with one leg. This strategy will move the robot and yields rewards, but much more slowly than the optimal solution: to balance on its legs and walk. So, it faces a choice between exploiting what it already knows (how to slide along the floor awkwardly) and exploring the space of actions (which might result in much faster locomotion). Similarly, in the chess example, the agent may learn a reasonable sequence of opening moves. Should it exploit this knowledge or explore different opening sequences? It is perhaps not obvious how deep learning fits into the reinforcement learning frame- work. There are several possible approaches, but one technique is to use deep networks to build a mapping from the observed world state to an action. This is known as a policy network. In the robot example, the policy network would learn a mapping from its sensor measurements to joint movements. In the chess example, the network would learn a mapping from the current state of the board to the choice of move (figure 1.13).\n",

The potential benefits in healthcare, design, entertainment, transport, education, and almost every area of commerce are enormous. However, scientists and engineers are often unrealistically optimistic about the outcomes of their work, and the potential for harm is just as great. The following paragraphs highlight five concerns. Bias and fairness: If we train a system to predict salary levels for individuals based on historical data, then this system will reproduce historical biases; for example, it will probably predict that women should be paid less than men. Several such cases have already become international news stories: an AI system for super-resolving face images made non-white people look more white; a system for generating images produced only pictures of men when asked to synthesize pictures of lawyers. Careless application of algorithmic decision-making using AI has the potential to entrench or aggravate existing biases. See Binns (2018) for further discussion. Explainability: Deep learning systems make decisions, but we do not usually know exactly how or based on what information. They may contain billions of parameters, and there is no way we can understand how they work based on examination. This has led to the sub-field of explainable AI. One moderately successful area is producing local explanations; we cannot explain the entire system, but we can produce an interpretable description of why a particular decision was made. However, it remains unknown whether it is possible to build complex decision-making systems that are fully transparent to their users or even their creators. See Grennan et al. (2022) for further information. Weaponizing AI: All significant technologies have been applied directly or indirectly toward war. Sadly, violent conflict seems to be an inevitable feature of human behavior. AI is arguably the most powerful technology ever built and will doubtless be deployed extensively in a military context. Indeed, this is already happening (Heikkilä, 2022).

They know that these technologies will allow them to reap enormous profits. Like any advanced technology, deep learning is likely to concentrate power in the hands of the few organizations that control it. Automating jobs that are currently done by humans will change the economic environment and disproportionately affect the livelihoods of lower-paid workers with fewer skills. Optimists argue similar disruptions happened during the industrial revolution and resulted in shorter working hours. The truth is that we simply do not know what effects the large-scale adoption of AI will have on society (see David, 2015). Existential risk: The major existential risks to the human race all result from tech- nology. Climate change has been driven by industrialization. Nuclear weapons derive from the study of physics. Pandemics are more probable and spread faster because in- novations in transport, agriculture, and construction have allowed a larger, denser, and more interconnected population. Artificial intelligence brings new existential risks. We should be very cautious about building systems that are more capable and extensible than human beings. In the most optimistic case, it will put vast power in the hands of the owners. In the most pessimistic case, we will be unable to control it or even understand its motives (see Tegmark, 2018). This list is far from exhaustive. AI could also enable surveillance, disinformation, violations of privacy, fraud, and manipulation of financial markets, and the energy re- quired to train AI systems contributes to climate change. Moreover, these concerns are not speculative; there are already many examples of ethically dubious applications of AI (consult Dao, 2021, for a partial list). In addition, the recent history of the inter- net has shown how new technology can cause harm in unexpected ways. The online community of the eighties and early nineties could hardly have predicted the prolifera- tion of fake news, spam, online harassment, fraud, cyberbullying, incel culture, political manipulation, doxxing, online radicalization, and revenge porn. Everyone studying or researching (or writing books about) AI should contemplate to what degree scientists are accountable for the uses of their technology. We should consider that capitalism primarily drives the development of AI and that legal advances and deployment for social good are likely to lag significantly behind. We should reflect on whether it’s possible, as scientists and engineers, to control progress in this field and to reduce the potential for harm. We should consider what kind of organizations we are prepared to work for. How serious are they in their commitment to reducing the potential harms of AI? Are they simply “ethics-washing” to reduce reputational risk, or do they actually implement mechanisms to halt ethically suspect projects? All readers are encouraged to investigate these issues further. The online course at https://ethics-of-ai.mooc.fi/ is a useful introductory resource. If you are a professor teaching from this book, you are encouraged to raise these issues with your students.

We describe shallow and deep neural networks and discuss how to train them and measure and improve their performance. Chap- ters 10–13 describe common architectural variations of deep neural networks, including convolutional networks, residual connections, and transformers. These architectures are used across supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning. Chapters 14–18 tackle unsupervised learning using deep neural networks. We devote a chapter each to four modern deep generative models: generative adversarial networks, variational autoencoders, normalizing flows, and diffusion models. Chapter 19 is a brief introduction to deep reinforcement learning. This is a topic that easily justifies its own book, so the treatment is necessarily superficial. However, this treatment is intended to be a good starting point for readers unfamiliar with this area. Despite the title of this book, some aspects of deep learning remain poorly under- stood. Chapter 20 poses some fundamental questions. Why are deep networks so easy to train? Why do they generalize so well? Why do they need so many parameters? Do they need to be deep? Along the way, we explore unexpected phenomena such as the structure of the loss function, double descent, grokking, and lottery tickets. The book concludes with chapter 21, which discusses ethics and deep learning.\n",

Chapter 2 Supervised learning A supervised learning model defines a mapping from one or more inputs to one or more outputs. For example, the input might be the age and mileage of a secondhand Toyota Prius, and the output might be the estimated value of the car in dollars. The model is just a mathematical equation; when the inputs are passed through this equation, it computes the output, and this is termed inference. The model equation also contains parameters. Different parameter values change the outcome of the computa- tion; the model equation describes a family of possible relationships between inputs and outputs, and the parameters specify the particular relationship. When we train or learn a model, we find parameters that describe the true relationship between inputs and outputs. A learning algorithm takes a training set of input/output pairs and manipulates the parameters until the inputs predict their corresponding out- puts as closely as possible. If the model works well for these training pairs, then we hope it will make good predictions for new inputs where the true output is unknown. The goal of this chapter is to expand on these ideas. First, we describe this framework more formally and introduce some notation. Then we work through a simple example in which we use a straight line to describe the relationship between input and output. This linear model is both familiar and easy to visualize, but nevertheless illustrates all the main ideas of supervised learning.\n",

The model is just a mathematical equation with a fixed form. It represents a family of different relations between the input and the output. The model also contains param- eters ϕ. The choice of parameters determines the particular relation between input and output, so we should really write: y = f[x, ϕ]. (2.2) When we talk about learning or training a model, we mean that we attempt to find parameters ϕ that make sensible output predictions from the input. We learn these parameters using a training dataset of I pairs of input and output examples {xi, yi}. We aim to select parameters that map each training input to its associated output as closely as possible. We quantify the degree of mismatch in this mapping with the loss L. This is a scalar value that summarizes how poorly the model predicts the training outputs from their corresponding inputs for parameters ϕ. We can treat the loss as a function L[ϕ] of these parameters. When we train the model, we are seeking parameters ˆ ϕ that minimize this loss function:1 ˆ ϕ = argmin ϕ h L [ϕ] i . (2.3) If the loss is small after this minimization, we have found model parameters that accu- rately predict the training outputs yi from the training inputs xi. After training a model, we must now assess its performance; we run the model on separate test data to see how well it generalizes to examples that it didn’t observe during training. If the performance is adequate, then we are ready to deploy the model.\n",

However, we need a principled approach for deciding which parameters ϕ are better than others. To this end, we assign a numerical value to each choice of parameters that quantifies the degree of mismatch between the model and the data. We term this value the loss; a lower loss means a better fit. The mismatch is captured by the deviation between the model predictions f[xi, ϕ] (height of the line at xi) and the ground truth outputs yi.

First, we tackle the model itself; 1D linear regression has the obvious drawback that it can only describe the relationship between the input and output as a straight line. Shallow neural networks (chapter 3) are only slightly more complex than linear regression but describe a much larger family of input/output relationships. Deep neural networks (chapter 4) are just as expressive but can describe complex functions with fewer parameters and work better in practice. Chapter 5 investigates loss functions for different tasks and reveals the theoretical underpinnings of the least-squares loss. Chapters 6 and 7 discuss the training process. Chapter 8 discusses how to measure model performance. Chapter 9 considers regular- ization techniques, which aim to improve that performance. 2This iterative approach is not actually necessary for the linear regression model. Here, it’s possible to find closed-form expressions for the parameters. However, this gradient descent approach works for more complex models where there is no closed-form solution and where there are too many parameters to evaluate the loss for every combination of values.

The goal is to find the y-intercept and slope parameters that correspond to the smallest loss. a) Iterative training algorithms initialize the parameters randomly and then improve them by “walking downhill” until no further improvement can be made. Here, we start at position 0 and move a certain distance downhill (perpendicular to the contours) to position 1. Then we re-calculate the downhill direction and move to position 2. Eventually, we reach the minimum of the function (position 4). b) Each position 0–4 from panel (a) corresponds to a different y-intercept and slope and so represents a different line. As the loss decreases, the lines fit the data more closely. Notes Loss functions vs. cost functions: In much of machine learning and in this book, the terms loss function and cost function are used interchangeably. However, more properly, a loss function is the individual term associated with a data point (i.e., each of the squared terms on the right- hand side of equation 2.5), and the cost function is the overall quantity that is minimized (i.e., the entire right-hand side of equation 2.5). A cost function can contain additional terms that are not associated with individual data points (see section 9.1). More generally, an objective function is any function that is to be maximized or minimized. Generative vs. discriminative models: The models y = f[x, ϕ] in this chapter are discrim- inative models. These make an output prediction y from real-world measurements x. Another Problem 2.3 approach is to build a generative model x = g[y, ϕ], in which the real-world measurements x are computed as a function of the output y. The generative approach has the disadvantage that it doesn’t directly predict y. To perform inference, we must invert the generative equation as y = g−1[x, ϕ], and this may be diﬀicult. However, generative models have the advantage that we can build in prior knowledge about how the data were created. For example, if we wanted to predict the 3D position and orientation y Draft: please send errata to udlbookmail@gmail.com. 24 2 Supervised learning of a car in an image x, then we could build knowledge about car shape, 3D geometry, and light transport into the function x = g[y, ϕ]. This seems like a good idea, but in fact, discriminative models dominate modern machine learning; the advantage gained from exploiting prior knowledge in generative models is usually trumped by learning very flexible discriminative models with large amounts of training data. Problems Problem 2.1 To walk “downhill” on the loss function (equation 2.5), we measure its gradient with respect to the parameters ϕ0 and ϕ1. Calculate expressions for the slopes ∂L/∂ϕ0 and ∂L/∂ϕ1. Problem 2.2 Show that we can find the minimum of the loss function in closed form by setting the expression for the derivatives from problem 2.1 to zero and solving for ϕ0 and ϕ1. Note that this works for linear regression but not for more complex models; this is why we use iterative model fitting methods like gradient descent (figure 2.4). Problem 2.3∗Consider reformulating linear regression as a generative model, so we have x = g[y, ϕ] = ϕ0 + ϕ1y. What is the new loss function? Find an expression for the inverse func- tion y = g−1[x, ϕ] that we would use to perform inference. Will this model make the same predictions as the discriminative version for a given training dataset {xi, yi}? One way to es- tablish this is to write code that fits a line to three data points using both methods and see if the result is the same.

Second, we compute the output by combining these hidden units with a linear function:1 y = ϕ0 + ϕ1h1 + ϕ2h2 + ϕ3h3. (3.4) Figure 3.3 shows the flow of computation that creates the function in figure 3.2a. Each hidden unit contains a linear function θ•0 + θ•1x of the input, and that line is clipped by the ReLU function a[•] below zero. The positions where the three lines cross zero become the three “joints” in the final output. The three clipped lines are then weighted by ϕ1, ϕ2, and ϕ3, respectively. Finally, the offset ϕ0 is added, which controls the overall height of the final function. Problems 3.1–3.8 Each linear region in figure 3.3j corresponds to a different activation pattern in the hidden units. When a unit is clipped, we refer to it as inactive, and when it is not clipped, we refer to it as active. For example, the shaded region receives contributions from h1 and h3 (which are active) but not from h2 (which is inactive). The slope of each linear region is determined by (i) the original slopes θ•1 of the active inputs for this region and (ii) the weights ϕ• that were subsequently applied. For example, the slope in the shaded region (see problem 3.3) is θ11ϕ1 + θ31ϕ3, where the first term is the slope in panel (g) and the second term is the slope in panel (i). Each hidden unit contributes one “joint” to the function, so with three hidden units, Notebook 3.1 Shallow networks I there can be four linear regions.

To see this, consider that every time we add a hidden unit, we add another linear region to the function.

The hidden units are combined to form the output in the usual way: y = ϕ0 + ϕ1h1 + ϕ2h2 + ϕ3h3. (3.10) Figure 3.8 illustrates the processing of this network. Each hidden unit receives a linear Problems 3.12–3.13 combination of the two inputs, which forms an oriented plane in the 3D input/output Notebook 3.2 Shallow networks II space. The activation function clips the negative values of these planes to zero. The clipped planes are then recombined in a second linear function (equation 3.10) to create a continuous piecewise linear surface consisting of convex polygonal regions (figure 3.8j). Appendix B.1.2 Convex region Each region corresponds to a different activation pattern. For example, in the central triangular region, the first and third hidden units are active, and the second is inactive. When there are more than two inputs to the model, it becomes diﬀicult to visualize. However, the interpretation is similar. The output will be a continuous piecewise linear function of the input, where the linear regions are now convex polytopes in the multi- dimensional input space. Note that as the input dimensions grow, the number of linear regions increases rapidly (figure 3.9). To get a feeling for how rapidly, consider that each hidden unit defines a hyperplane that delineates the part of space where this unit is active from the part Notebook 3.3 Shallow network regions where it is not (cyan lines in 3.8d–f). If we had the same number of hidden units as input dimensions Di, we could align each hyperplane with one of the coordinate axes (figure 3.10). For two input dimensions, this would divide the space into four quadrants. For three dimensions, this would create eight octants, and for Di dimensions, this would create 2Di orthants. Shallow neural networks usually have more hidden units than input dimensions, so they typically create more than 2Di linear regions.\n",

History of neural networks: McCulloch & Pitts (1943) first came up with the notion of an artificial neuron that combined inputs to produce an output, but this model did not have a prac- tical learning algorithm. Rosenblatt (1958) developed the perceptron, which linearly combined inputs and then thresholded them to make a yes/no decision. He also provided an algorithm to learn the weights from data. Minsky & Papert (1969) argued that the linear function was inadequate for general classification problems but that adding hidden layers with nonlinear activation functions (hence the term multi-layer perceptron) could allow the learning of more general input/output relations. However, they concluded that Rosenblatt’s algorithm could not learn the parameters of such models. It was not until the 1980s that a practical algorithm (backpropagation, see chapter 7) was developed, and significant work on neural networks re- sumed. The history of neural networks is chronicled by Kurenkov (2020), Sejnowski (2018), and Schmidhuber (2022). Activation functions: The ReLU function has been used as far back as Fukushima (1969). However, in the early days of neural networks, it was more common to use the logistic sigmoid or tanh activation functions (figure 3.13a). The ReLU was re-popularized by Jarrett et al. (2009), Nair & Hinton (2010), and Glorot et al. (2011) and is an important part of the success story of modern neural networks. It has the nice property that the derivative of the output with respect to the input is always one for inputs greater than zero. This contributes to the stability and eﬀiciency of training (see chapter 7) and contrasts with the derivatives of sigmoid activation Draft: please send errata to udlbookmail@gmail.com. 38 3 Shallow neural networks functions, which saturate (become close to zero) for large positive and large negative inputs. However, the ReLU function has the disadvantage that its derivative is zero for negative inputs. If all the training examples produce negative inputs to a given ReLU function, then we cannot improve the parameters feeding into this ReLU during training. The gradient with respect to the incoming weights is locally flat, so we cannot “walk downhill.” This is known as the dying ReLU problem. Many variations on the ReLU have been proposed to resolve this problem (figure 3.13b), including (i) the leaky ReLU (Maas et al., 2013), which also has a linear output for negative values with a smaller slope of 0.1, (ii) the parametric ReLU (He et al., 2015), which treats the slope of the negative portion as an unknown parameter, and (iii) the concatenated ReLU (Shang et al., 2016), which produces two outputs, one of which clips below zero (i.e., like a typical ReLU) and one of which clips above zero. A variety of smooth functions have also been investigated (figure 3.13c–d), including the soft- plus function (Glorot et al., 2011), Gaussian error linear unit (Hendrycks & Gimpel, 2016), sigmoid linear unit (Hendrycks & Gimpel, 2016), and exponential linear unit (Clevert et al., 2015). Most of these are attempts to avoid the dying ReLU problem while limiting the gradient for negative values. Klambauer et al. (2017) introduced the scaled exponential linear unit (fig- ure 3.13e), which is particularly interesting as it helps stabilize the variance of the activations when the input variance has a limited range (see section 7.5). Ramachandran et al. (2017) adopted an empirical approach to choosing an activation function. They searched the space of possible functions to find the one that performed best over a variety of supervised learning tasks. The optimal function was found to be a[x] = x/(1 + exp[−βx]), where β is a learned parameter (figure 3.13f). They termed this function Swish. Interestingly, this was a rediscovery of activation functions previously proposed by Hendrycks & Gimpel (2016) and Elfwing et al. (2018). Howard et al. (2019) approximated Swish by the HardSwish function, which has a very similar shape but is faster to compute: HardSwish[z] =      0 z < −3 z(z + 3)/6 −3 ≤z ≤3 z z > 3 . (3.13) There is no definitive answer as to which of these activations functions is empirically superior. However, the leaky ReLU, parameterized ReLU, and many of the continuous functions can be shown to provide minor performance gains over the ReLU in particular situations. We restrict attention to neural networks with the basic ReLU function for the rest of this book because it’s easy to characterize the functions they create in terms of the number of linear regions. Universal approximation theorem: The width version of this theorem states that there exists a network with one hidden layer containing a finite number of hidden units that can approximate any specified continuous function on a compact subset of Rn to arbitrary accuracy. This was proved by Cybenko (1989) for a class of sigmoid activations and was later shown to be true for a larger class of nonlinear activation functions (Hornik, 1991). Number of linear regions: Consider a shallow network with Di ≥2-dimensional inputs and D hidden units. The number of linear regions is determined by the intersections of the D hyperplanes created by the “joints” in the ReLU functions (e.g., figure 3.8d–f). Each region is created by a different combination of the ReLU functions clipping or not clipping the input. Appendix B.2 Binomial coeﬀicient The number of regions created by D hyperplanes in the Di ≤D-dimensional input space was Problem 3.18 shown by Zaslavsky (1975) to be at most PDi j=0 \u0000D j \u0001 (i.e., a sum of binomial coeﬀicients). As a rule of thumb, shallow neural networks almost always have a larger number D of hidden units than input dimensions Di and create between 2Di and 2D linear regions.

Notes 39 Linear, aﬀine, and nonlinear functions: Technically, a linear transformation f[•] is any function that obeys the principle of superposition, so f[a+b] = f[a]+f[b]. This definition implies that f[2a] = 2f[a].The weighted sum f[h1, h2, h3] = ϕ1h1 + ϕ2h2 + ϕ3h3 is linear, but once the offset (bias) is added so f[h1, h2, h3] = ϕ0 + ϕ1h1 + ϕ2h2 + ϕ3h3, this is no longer true. To see this, consider that the output is doubled when we double the arguments of the former function. This is not the case for the latter function, which is more properly termed an aﬀine function. However, it is common in machine learning to conflate these terms. We follow this convention in this book and refer to both as linear. All other functions we will encounter are nonlinear. Problems Problem 3.1 What kind of mapping from input to output would be created if the activation function in equation 3.1 was linear so that a[z] = ψ0 + ψ1z?

Problem 3.12 How many parameters does the model in figure 3.7 have? Problem 3.13 What is the activation pattern for each of the seven regions in figure 3.8?

There should be three equations to compute the three hidden units from the inputs and two equations to compute the outputs from the hidden units.

Problem 3.18∗Show that the maximum number of regions created by a shallow network with Di = 2-dimensional input, Do = 1-dimensional output, and D = 3 hidden units is seven, as in figure 3.8j. Use the result of Zaslavsky (1975) that the maximum number of regions created by partitioning a Di-dimensional space with D hyperplanes is PDi j=0 \u0000D j \u0001 . What is the maximum number of regions if we add two more hidden units to this model, so D = 5? This work is subject to a Creative Commons CC-BY-NC-ND license. (C) MIT Press. Chapter 4 Deep neural networks The last chapter described shallow neural networks, which have a single hidden layer. This chapter introduces deep neural networks, which have more than one hidden layer. With ReLU activation functions, both shallow and deep networks describe piecewise linear mappings from input to output. As the number of hidden units increases, shallow neural networks improve their descriptive power. Indeed, with enough hidden units, shallow networks can describe arbitrarily complex functions in high dimensions. However, it turns out that for some functions, the required number of hidden units is impractically large. Deep networks can produce many more linear regions than shallow networks for a given number of parame- ters. Hence, from a practical standpoint, they can be used to describe a broader family of functions.\n",

This means that three different ranges of x are mapped to the same output range y ∈[−1, 1], and the subsequent mapping from this range of y to y′ is applied three times. The overall effect is that the Notebook 4.1 Composing networks function defined by the second network is duplicated three times to create nine linear regions. The same principle applies in higher dimensions (figure 4.2). A different way to think about composing networks is that the first network “folds” the input space x back onto itself so that multiple inputs generate the same output.

In chapters 6 and 7, we deal with the training process itself, in which we seek the parameter values that minimize this loss. Notes Deep learning: It has long been understood that it is possible to build more complex functions by composing shallow neural networks or developing networks with more than one hidden layer. Indeed, the term “deep learning” was first used by Dechter (1986). However, interest was limited due to practical concerns; it was not possible to train such networks well. The modern era of deep learning was kick-started by startling improvements in image classification reported by Krizhevsky et al. (2012). This sudden progress was arguably due to the confluence of four factors: larger training datasets, improved processing power for training, the use of the ReLU activation function, and the use of stochastic gradient descent (see chapter 6). LeCun et al. (2015) present an overview of early advances in the modern era of deep learning. Number of linear regions: For deep networks using a total of D hidden units with ReLU activations, the upper bound on the number of regions is 2D (Montufar et al., 2014). The same authors show that a deep ReLU network with Di-dimensional input and K layers, each containing D ≥Di hidden units, has O \u0010 (D/Di)(K−1)DiDDi \u0011 linear regions. Montúfar (2017), Arora et al. (2016) and Serra et al. (2018) all provide tighter upper bounds that consider the possibility that each layer has different numbers of hidden units. Serra et al. (2018) provide an algorithm that counts the number of linear regions in a neural network, although it is only practical for very small networks. If the number of hidden units D in each of the K layers is the same, and D is an integer multiple of the input dimensionality Di, then the maximum number of linear regions Nr can be This work is subject to a Creative Commons CC-BY-NC-ND license. (C) MIT Press. Notes 53 computed exactly and is: Nr = \u0012 D Di + 1 \u0013Di(K−1) · Di X j=0   D j ! . (4.17) The first term in this expression corresponds to the first K −1 layers of the network, which can be thought of as repeatedly folding the input space. However, we now need to devote D/Di hidden units to each input dimension to create these folds. The last term in this equation (a sum of binomial coeﬀicients) is the number of regions that a shallow network can create and is Appendix B.2 Binomial coeﬀicient attributable to the last layer. For further information, consult Montufar et al. (2014), Pascanu et al. (2013), and Montúfar (2017). Universal approximation theorem: We argued in section 4.5.1 that if the layers of a deep network have enough hidden units, then the width version of the universal approximation the- orem applies: there exists a network that can approximate any given continuous function on a compact subset of RDi to arbitrary accuracy. Lu et al. (2017) proved that there exists a network with ReLU activation functions and at least Di + 4 hidden units in each layer can approximate any specified Di-dimensional Lebesgue integrable function to arbitrary accuracy given enough layers. This is known as the depth version of the universal approximation theorem. Depth eﬀiciency: Several results show that there are functions that can be realized by deep networks but not by any shallow network whose capacity is bounded above exponentially. In other words, it would take an exponentially larger number of units in a shallow network to describe these functions accurately. This is known as the depth eﬀiciency of neural networks. Telgarsky (2016) shows that for any integer k, it is possible to construct networks with one input, one output, and O[k3] layers of constant width, which cannot be realized with O[k] layers and less than 2k width. Perhaps surprisingly, Eldan & Shamir (2016) showed that when there are multivariate inputs, there is a three-layer network that cannot be realized by any two-layer network if the capacity is sub-exponential in the input dimension. Cohen et al. (2016), Safran & Shamir (2017), and Poggio et al. (2017) also demonstrate functions that deep networks can approximate eﬀiciently, but shallow ones cannot. Liang & Srikant (2016) show that for a broad class of functions, including univariate functions, shallow networks require exponentially more hidden units than deep networks for a given upper bound on the approximation error. Width eﬀiciency: Lu et al. (2017) investigate whether there are wide shallow networks (i.e., shallow networks with lots of hidden units) that cannot be realized by narrow networks whose depth is not substantially larger. They show that there exist classes of wide, shallow networks that can only be expressed by narrow networks with polynomial depth. This is known as the width eﬀiciency of neural networks. This polynomial lower bound on width is less restrictive than the exponential lower bound on depth, suggesting that depth is more important. Vardi et al. (2022) subsequently showed that the price for making the width small is only a linear increase in the network depth for networks with ReLU activations.

Chapter 5 Loss functions The last three chapters described linear regression, shallow neural networks, and deep neural networks. Each represents a family of functions that map input to output, where the particular member of the family is determined by the model parameters ϕ. When we train these models, we seek the parameters that produce the best possible mapping from input to output for the task we are considering. This chapter defines what is meant by the “best possible” mapping. That definition requires a training dataset {xi, yi} of input/output pairs. A loss function or cost function L[ϕ] returns a single number that describes the mismatch between the model predictions f[xi, ϕ] and their corresponding ground-truth outputs yi. During training, we seek parameter values ϕ that minimize the loss and hence map the training inputs to the outputs as closely as possible. We saw one example of a loss function in chapter 2; the least squares loss function is suitable for univariate regression problems for which the target is a real number y ∈R. It computes the sum of the squares Appendix A Number sets of the deviations between the model predictions f[xi, ϕ] and the true values yi. This chapter provides a framework that both justifies the choice of the least squares criterion for real-valued outputs and allows us to build loss functions for other prediction types. We consider binary classification, where the prediction y ∈{0, 1} is one of two categories, multiclass classification, where the prediction y ∈{1, 2, . . . , K} is one of K categories, and more complex cases. In the following two chapters, we address model training, where the goal is to find the parameter values that minimize these loss functions.\n",

Second, we assume that the conditional distribu- tions Pr(yi|xi) of the output given the input are independent, so the total likelihood of Appendix C.1.5 Independence the training data decomposes as: Pr(y1, y2, . . . , yI|x1, x2, . . . , xI) = I Y i=1 Pr(yi|xi).

The remaining second term is known as the cross-entropy. It can be interpreted as the amount of uncertainty that remains in one distribution after taking into account what we already know from the other.

We are left with a finite set of weighted probability masses centered on the data points. In the last line, we have eliminated the constant scaling factor 1/I, as this does not affect the position of the minimum. In machine learning, the distribution parameters θ are computed by the model f[xi, ϕ], so we have: ˆ ϕ = argmin ϕ \" − I X i=1 log \u0002 Pr(yi|f[xi, ϕ]) \u0003 # . (5.31) This is precisely the negative log-likelihood criterion from the recipe in section 5.2.

In previous chapters, we developed neural network models. In this chapter, we de- veloped loss functions for deciding how well a model describes the training data for a given set of parameters. The next chapter considers model training, in which we aim to find the model parameters that minimize this loss. Notes Losses based on the normal distribution: Nix & Weigend (1994) and Williams (1996) investigated heteroscedastic nonlinear regression in which both the mean and the variance of the output are functions of the input. In the context of unsupervised learning, Burda et al. (2016) use a loss function based on a multivariate normal distribution with diagonal covariance, and Dorta et al. (2018) use a loss function based on a normal distribution with full covariance. Robust regression: Qi et al. (2020) investigate the properties of regression models that min- imize mean absolute error rather than mean squared error. This loss function follows from assuming a Laplace distribution over the outputs and estimates the median output for a given input rather than the mean. Barron (2019) presents a loss function that parameterizes the de- gree of robustness. When interpreted in a probabilistic context, it yields a family of univariate probability distributions that includes the normal and Cauchy distributions as special cases. Estimating quantiles: Sometimes, we may not want to estimate the mean or median in a regression task but may instead want to predict a quantile. For example, this is useful for risk models, where we want to know that the true value will be less than the predicted value 90% of the time. This is known as quantile regression (Koenker & Hallock, 2001). This could be done by fitting a heteroscedastic regression model and then estimating the quantile based on the predicted normal distribution. Alternatively, the quantiles can be estimated directly using quantile loss (also known as pinball loss). In practice, this minimizes the absolute deviations of the data from the model but weights the deviations in one direction more than the other. Recent work has investigated simultaneously predicting multiple quantiles to get an idea of the overall distribution shape (Rodrigues & Pereira, 2020). Class imbalance and focal loss: Lin et al. (2017c) address data imbalance in classification problems. If the number of examples for some classes is much greater than for others, then the standard maximum likelihood loss does not work well; the model may concentrate on becoming more confident about well-classified examples from the dominant classes and classify less well- represented classes poorly. Lin et al. (2017c) introduce focal loss, which adds a single extra parameter that down-weights the effect of well-classified examples to improve performance. Learning to rank: Cao et al. (2007), Xia et al. (2008), and Chen et al. (2009) all used the Plackett-Luce model in loss functions for learning to rank data. This is the listwise approach to learning to rank as the model ingests an entire list of objects to be ranked at once. Alternative approaches are the pointwise approach, in which the model ingests a single object, and the pairwise approach, where the model ingests pairs of objects. Chen et al. (2009) summarize different approaches for learning to rank. Other data types: Fan et al. (2020) use a loss based on the beta distribution for predicting values between zero and one. Jacobs et al. (1991) and Bishop (1994) investigated mixture density networks for multimodal data. These model the output as a mixture of Gaussians Draft: please send errata to udlbookmail@gmail.com. 74 5 Loss functions Figure 5.13 The von Mises distribu- tion is defined over the circular do- main (−π, π]. It has two parameters. The mean µ determines the position of the peak. The concentration κ > 0 acts like the inverse of the vari- ance. Hence 1/√κ is roughly equivalent to the standard deviation in a normal distribution. (see figure 5.14) that is conditional on the input. Prokudin et al. (2018) used the von Mises distribution to predict direction (see figure 5.13). Fallah et al. (2009) constructed loss functions for prediction counts using the Poisson distribution (see figure 5.15). Ng et al. (2017) used loss functions based on the gamma distribution to predict duration. Non-probabilistic approaches: It is not strictly necessary to adopt the probabilistic ap- proach discussed in this chapter, but this has become the default in recent years; any loss func- tion that aims to reduce the distance between the model output and the training outputs will suﬀice, and distance can be defined in any way that seems sensible. There are several well-known non-probabilistic machine learning models for classification, including support vector machines (Vapnik, 1995; Cristianini & Shawe-Taylor, 2000), which use hinge loss, and AdaBoost (Freund & Schapire, 1997), which uses exponential loss. Problems Problem 5.1 Show that the logistic sigmoid function sig[z] maps z = −∞to 0, z = 0 to 0.5 and z = ∞to 1 where: sig[z] = 1 1 + exp[−z]. (5.32) Problem 5.2 The loss L for binary classification for a single training pair {x, y} is: L = −(1 −y) log h 1 −sig[f[x, ϕ]] i −y log h sig[f[x, ϕ]] i , (5.33) where sig[•] is defined in equation 5.32. Plot this loss as a function of the transformed network output sig[f[x, ϕ]] ∈[0, 1] (i) when the training label y = 0 and (ii) when y = 1. Problem 5.3∗Suppose we want to build a model that predicts the direction y in radians of the prevailing wind based on local measurements of barometric pressure x. A suitable distribution over circular domains is the von Mises distribution (figure 5.13): Pr(y|µ, κ) = exp \u0002 κ cos[y −µ] \u0003 2π · Bessel0[κ] , (5.34) This work is subject to a Creative Commons CC-BY-NC-ND license. (C) MIT Press. Notes 75 Figure 5.14 Multimodal data and mixture of Gaussians density. a) Example training data where, for intermediate values of the input x, the corresponding output y follows one of two paths. For example, at x = 0, the output y might be roughly −2 or +3 but is unlikely to be between these values. b) The mixture of Gaussians is a probability model suited to this kind of data. As the name suggests, the model is a weighted sum (solid cyan curve) of two or more normal distributions with different means and variances (here, two weighted distributions, dashed blue and orange curves). When the means are far apart, this forms a multimodal distribution. c) When the means are close, the mixture can model unimodal but non-normal densities. where µ is a measure of the mean direction and κ is a measure of the concentration (i.e., the inverse of the variance). The term Bessel0[κ] is a modified Bessel function of order 0. Use the recipe from section 5.2 to develop a loss function for learning the parameter µ of a model f[x, ϕ] to predict the most likely wind direction. Your solution should treat the concen- tration κ as constant. How would you perform inference? Problem 5.4∗ Sometimes, the outputs y for input x are multimodal (figure 5.14a); there is more than one valid prediction for a given input. Here, we might use a weighted sum of normal components as the distribution over the output. This is known as a mixture of Gaussians model. For example, a mixture of two Gaussians has parameters θ = {λ, µ1, σ2 1, µ2, σ2 2}: Pr(y|λ, µ1, µ2, σ2 1, σ2 2) = λ p 2πσ2 1 exp \u0014−(y −µ1)2 2σ2 1 \u0015 + 1 −λ p 2πσ2 2 exp \u0014−(y −µ2)2 2σ2 2 \u0015 , (5.35) where λ ∈[0, 1] controls the relative weight of the two components, which have means µ1, µ2 and variances σ2 1, σ2 2, respectively. This model can represent a distribution with two peaks (figure 5.14b) or a distribution with one peak but a more complex shape (figure 5.14c). Use the recipe from section 5.2 to construct a loss function for training a model f[x, ϕ] that takes input x, has parameters ϕ, and predicts a mixture of two Gaussians. The loss should be based on I training data pairs {xi, yi}. What problems do you foresee when performing inference?

It has a single parameter λ ∈R+, which is known as the rate and is the mean of the distribution. a–c) Poisson distributions with rates of 1.4, 2.8, and 6.0, respectively. Problem 5.6 Consider building a model to predict the number of pedestrians y ∈{0, 1, 2, . . .} that will pass a given point in the city in the next minute, based on data x that contains information about the time of day, the longitude and latitude, and the type of neighborhood. A suitable distribution for modeling counts is the Poisson distribution (figure 5.15). This has a single parameter λ > 0 called the rate that represents the mean of the distribution. The distribution has probability density function: Pr(y = k) = λke−λ k! . (5.36) Design a loss function for this model assuming we have access to I training pairs {xi, yi}. Problem 5.7 Consider a multivariate regression problem where we predict ten outputs, so y ∈ R10, and model each with an independent normal distribution where the means µd are pre- dicted by the network, and variances σ2 are constant. Write an expression for the likeli- hood Pr(y|f[x, ϕ]). Show that minimizing the negative log-likelihood of this model is still equivalent to minimizing a sum of squared terms if we don’t estimate the variance σ2. Problem 5.8∗Construct a loss function for making multivariate predictions y ∈RDi based on independent normal distributions with different variances σ2 d for each dimension. Assume a heteroscedastic model so that both the means µd and variances σ2 d vary as a function of the data. Problem 5.9∗Consider a multivariate regression problem in which we predict the height of a person in meters and their weight in kilos from data x. Here, the units take quite different ranges. What problems do you see this causing? Propose two solutions to these problems. Problem 5.10 Extend the model from problem 5.3 to predict both the wind direction and the wind speed and define the associated loss function.

These represent families of piecewise linear functions, where the parameters determine the particular function. Chapter 5 introduced the loss — a single number representing the mismatch between the network predictions and the ground truth for a training set. The loss depends on the network parameters, and this chapter considers how to find the parameter values that minimize this loss. This is known as learning the network’s parameters or simply as training or fitting the model. The process is to choose initial parameter values and then iterate the following two steps: (i) compute the derivatives (gradients) of the loss with respect to the parameters, and (ii) adjust the parameters based on the gradients to decrease the loss. After many iterations, we hope to reach the overall minimum of the loss function. This chapter tackles the second of these steps; we consider algorithms that adjust the parameters to decrease the loss. Chapter 7 discusses how to initialize the parameters and compute the gradients for neural networks.\n",

Convexity implies that wherever we initialize the parameters, we are bound to reach the minimum if we keep walking downhill; the training procedure can’t fail. Unfortunately, loss functions for most nonlinear models, including both shallow and deep networks, are non-convex. Visualizing neural network loss functions is challenging due to the number of parameters.

As long as the gradient descent algorithm is initialized in the right “valley” of the loss function (e.g., points 1 and 3), the parameter estimate will move steadily toward the global minimum. However, if it is initialized outside this valley (e.g., point 2), it will descend toward one of the local minima. b) Stochastic gradient descent adds noise to the optimization process, so it is possible to escape from the wrong valley (e.g., point 2) and still reach the global minimum. In addition, the loss function contains saddle points (e.g., the blue cross in figure 6.4). Here, the gradient is zero, but the function increases in some directions and decreases in others. If the current parameters are not exactly at the saddle point, then gradient descent can escape by moving downhill.

At each iteration, the algorithm chooses a random subset of the training data and computes the gradient from these examples alone. This subset is known as a minibatch or batch for short. The update rule for the model parameters ϕt at iteration t is hence: ϕt+1 ← −ϕt −α · X i∈Bt ∂ℓi[ϕt] ∂ϕ , (6.10) where Bt is a set containing the indices of the input/output pairs in the current batch and, as before, ℓi is the loss due to the ith pair. The term α is the learning rate, and together with the gradient magnitude, determines the distance moved at each iteration. The learning rate is chosen at the start of the procedure and does not depend on the local properties of the function. The batches are usually drawn from the dataset without replacement. The algorithm works through the training examples until it has used all the data, at which point it Problem 6.9 starts sampling from the full training dataset again. A single pass through the entire training dataset is referred to as an epoch. A batch may be as small as a single example or as large as the whole dataset. The latter case is called full-batch gradient descent and is identical to regular (non-stochastic) gradient descent. An alternative interpretation of SGD is that it computes the gradient of a different loss function at each iteration; the loss function depends on both the model and the training data and hence will differ for each randomly selected batch. In this view, SGD performs deterministic gradient descent on a constantly changing loss function (figure 6.6).

Fourth, it can (in principle) escape local minima. Fifth, it reduces the chances of getting stuck near saddle points; it is likely that at least some of the possible batches will have a significant gradient at any point on the loss function. Finally, there is some evidence that SGD finds parameters for neural networks that cause them to generalize well to new data in practice (see section 9.2). SGD does not necessarily “converge” in the traditional sense. However, the hope is that when we are close to the global minimum, all the data points will be well described by the model. Consequently, the gradient will be small, whichever batch is chosen, and the parameters will cease to change much. In practice, SGD is often applied with a learning rate schedule. The learning rate α starts at a high value and is decreased by a constant factor every N epochs. The logic is that in the early stages of training, we want the algorithm to explore the parameter space, jumping from valley to valley to find a sensible region. In later stages, we are roughly in the right place and are more concerned with fine-tuning the parameters, so we decrease α to make smaller changes.\n",

A straightforward approach is to normalize the gradients so that we move a fixed distance (governed by the learning rate) in each direction. To do this, we first measure the gradient mt+1 and the pointwise squared gradient vt+1: mt+1 ← ∂L[ϕt] ∂ϕ vt+1 ← \u0012∂L[ϕt] ∂ϕ \u00132 .

The term vt+1 is the squared gradient, and the positive root of this is used to normalize the gradient itself, so all that remains is the sign in each coordinate direction. The result is that the algorithm moves a fixed distance α along each coordinate, where the direction is determined by whichever way is downhill (figure 6.9c). This simple algorithm makes good progress in both directions but will not converge unless it happens to land exactly at the minimum. Instead, it will bounce back and forth around the minimum. Adaptive moment estimation, or Adam, takes this idea and adds momentum to both the estimate of the gradient and the squared gradient: This work is subject to a Creative Commons CC-BY-NC-ND license.

This is accomplished by normalizing the gradient magnitude and retaining only the sign.

Using momentum is equivalent to taking a weighted average over the history of each of these statistics. At the start of the procedure, all the previous measurements are effectively zero, resulting in unrealistically small estimates. Consequently, we modify these statistics using the rule: ˜ mt+1 ← mt+1 1 −βt+1 ˜ vt+1 ← vt+1 1 −γt+1 .

As we shall see in chapter 7, the gradient magnitudes of neural network parameters can depend on their depth in the network. Adam helps compensate for this tendency and balances out changes across the different layers. In practice, Adam also has the advantage of being less sensitive to the initial learning rate because it avoids situations like those in figures 6.9a–b, so it doesn’t need complex learning rate schedules.

Stochastic gradient descent helps mitigate these problems.1 At each iteration, we use a different random subset of the data (a batch) to compute the gradient. This adds noise to the process and helps prevent the algorithm from getting trapped in a sub-optimal region of parameter space. Each iteration is also computation- ally cheaper since it only uses a subset of the data. We saw that adding a momentum term makes convergence more eﬀicient. Finally, we introduced the Adam algorithm. The ideas in this chapter apply to optimizing any model. The next chapter tackles two aspects of training specific to neural networks. First, we address how to compute the gradients of the loss with respect to the parameters of a neural network. This is accomplished using the famous backpropagation algorithm. Second, we discuss how to initialize the network parameters before optimization begins. Without careful initializa- tion, the gradients used by the optimization can become extremely large or extremely small, which can hinder the training process. Notes Optimization algorithms: Optimization algorithms are used extensively throughout engi- neering, and it is generally more typical to use the term objective function rather than loss function or cost function. Gradient descent was invented by Cauchy (1847), and stochastic gra- dient descent dates back to at least Robbins & Monro (1951). A modern compromise between the two is stochastic variance-reduced descent (Johnson & Zhang, 2013), in which the full gra- dient is computed periodically, with stochastic updates interspersed. Reviews of optimization algorithms for neural networks can be found in Ruder (2016), Bottou et al. (2018), and Sun (2020). Bottou (2012) discusses best practice for SGD, including shuffling without replacement. 1Chapter 20 discusses the extent to which saddle points and local minima really are problems in deep learning. In practice, deep networks are surprisingly easy to train.

This can be tested algebraically by considering the Hessian matrix (the matrix of second derivatives): H[ϕ] =         ∂2L ∂ϕ2 0 ∂2L ∂ϕ0∂ϕ1 . . . ∂2L ∂ϕ0∂ϕN ∂2L ∂ϕ1∂ϕ0 ∂2L ∂ϕ2 1 . . . ∂2L ∂ϕ1∂ϕN . . . . . . ... . . . ∂2L ∂ϕN ∂ϕ0 ∂2L ∂ϕN ∂ϕ1 . . . ∂2L ∂ϕ2 N         . (6.19) If the Hessian matrix is positive definite (has positive eigenvalues) for all possible parameter Appendix B.3.7 Eigenvalues values, then the function is convex; the loss function will look like a smooth bowl (as in fig- ure 6.1c), so training will be relatively easy. There will be a single global minimum and no local minima or saddle points. For any loss function, the eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix at places where the gradient is zero allow us to classify this position as (i) a minimum (the eigenvalues are all positive), (ii) a maximum (the eigenvalues are all negative), or (iii) a saddle point (positive eigenvalues are associated with directions in which we are at a minimum and negative ones with directions where we are at a maximum). Line search: Gradient descent with a fixed step size is ineﬀicient because the distance moved depends entirely on the magnitude of the gradient. It moves a long distance when the function is changing fast (where perhaps it should be more cautious) but a short distance when the function is changing slowly (where perhaps it should explore further). For this reason, gradient descent methods are usually combined with a line search procedure in which we sample the function along the desired direction to try to find the optimal step size. One such approach is bracketing (figure 6.10). Another problem with gradient descent is that it tends to lead to ineﬀicient oscillatory behavior when descending valleys (e.g., path 1 in figure 6.5a). Beyond gradient descent: Numerous algorithms have been developed that remedy the prob- lems of gradient descent. Most notable is the Newton method, which takes the curvature of the surface into account using the inverse of the Hessian matrix; if the gradient of the function is changing quickly, then it applies a more cautious update. This method eliminates the need for line search and does not suffer from oscillatory behavior. However, it has its own problems; in its simplest form, it moves toward the nearest extremum, but this may be a maximum if we are closer to the top of a hill than we are to the bottom of a valley. Moreover, computing the Problem 6.11 inverse Hessian is intractable when the number of parameters is large, as in neural networks. Properties of SGD: The limit of SGD as the learning rate tends to zero is a stochastic differential equation. Jastrzębski et al. (2018) showed that this equation relies on the learning- rate to batch size ratio and that there is a relation between the learning rate to batch size ratio and the width of the minimum found. Wider minima are considered more desirable; if the loss function for test data is similar, then small errors in the parameter estimates will have little effect on test performance. He et al. (2019) prove a generalization bound for SGD that has a positive correlation with the ratio of batch size to learning rate. They train a large number of models on different architectures and datasets and find empirical evidence that test accuracy improves when the ratio of batch size to learning rate is low. Smith et al. (2018) and Goyal et al. (2018) also identified the ratio of batch size to learning rate as being important for generalization (see figure 20.10). Momentum: The idea of using momentum to speed up optimization dates to Polyak (1964). Goh (2017) presents an in-depth discussion of the properties of momentum. The Nesterov This work is subject to a Creative Commons CC-BY-NC-ND license. (C) MIT Press. Notes 93 Figure 6.10 Line search using the bracketing approach. a) The current solution is at position a (orange point), and we wish to search the region [a, d] (gray shaded area). We define two points b, c interior to the search region and evaluate the loss function at these points. Here L[b] > L[c], so we eliminate the range [a, b]. b) We now repeat this procedure in the refined search region and find that L[b] < L[c], so we eliminate the range [c, d]. c) We repeat this process until this minimum is closely bracketed. accelerated gradient method was introduced by Nesterov (1983). Nesterov momentum was first applied in the context of stochastic gradient descent by Sutskever et al. (2013). Adaptive training algorithms: AdaGrad (Duchi et al., 2011) is an optimization algorithm that addresses the possibility that some parameters may have to move further than others by assigning a different learning rate to each parameter. AdaGrad uses the cumulative squared gradient for each parameter to attenuate its learning rate. This has the disadvantage that the learning rates decrease over time, and learning can halt before the minimum is found. RMSProp (Hinton et al., 2012a) and AdaDelta (Zeiler, 2012) modified this algorithm to help prevent these problems by recursively updating the squared gradient term. By far the most widely used adaptive training algorithm is adaptive moment optimization or Adam (Kingma & Ba, 2015). This combines the ideas of momentum (in which the gradient vector is averaged over time) and AdaGrad, AdaDelta, and RMSProp (in which a smoothed squared gradient term is used to modify the learning rate for each parameter). The original paper on the Adam algorithm provided a convergence proof for convex loss functions, but a counterexample was identified by Reddi et al. (2018), who developed a modification of Adam called AMSGrad, which does converge. Of course, in deep learning, the loss functions are non- convex, and Zaheer et al. (2018) subsequently developed an adaptive algorithm called YOGI and proved that it converges in this scenario. Regardless of these theoretical objections, the original Adam algorithm works well in practice and is widely used, not least because it works well over a broad range of hyperparameters and makes rapid initial progress. One potential problem with adaptive training algorithms is that the learning rates are based on accumulated statistics of the observed gradients. At the start of training, when there are few samples, these statistics may be very noisy. This can be remedied by learning rate warm-up (Goyal et al., 2018), in which the learning rates are gradually increased over the first few thou- sand iterations. An alternative solution is rectified Adam (Liu et al., 2021a), which gradually Draft: please send errata to udlbookmail@gmail.com. 94 6 Fitting models changes the momentum term over time in a way that helps avoid high variance. Dozat (2016) incorporated Nesterov momentum into the Adam algorithm. SGD vs. Adam: There has been a lively discussion about the relative merits of SGD and Adam. Wilson et al. (2017) provided evidence that SGD with momentum can find lower minima than Adam, which generalizes better over a variety of deep learning tasks. However, this is strange since SGD is a special case of Adam (when β = γ = 0) once the modification term (equation 6.16) becomes one, which happens quickly. It is hence more likely that SGD outperforms Adam when we use Adam’s default hyperparameters. Loshchilov & Hutter (2019) proposed AdamW, which substantially improves the performance of Adam in the presence of L2 regularization (see section 9.1). Choi et al. (2019) provide evidence that if we search for the best Adam hyperparameters, it performs just as well as SGD and converges faster. Keskar & Socher (2017) proposed a method called SWATS that starts using Adam (to make rapid initial progress) and then switches to SGD (to get better final generalization performance). Exhaustive search: All the algorithms discussed in this chapter are iterative. A completely different approach is to quantize the network parameters and exhaustively search the resulting discretized parameter space using SAT solvers (Mézard & Mora, 2009). This approach has the potential to find the global minimum and provide a guarantee that there is no lower loss elsewhere but is only practical for very small models. Problems Problem 6.1 Show that the derivatives of the least squares loss function in equation 6.5 are given by the expressions in equation 6.7. Problem 6.2 A surface is convex if the eigenvalues of the Hessian H[ϕ] are positive everywhere. In this case, the surface has a unique minimum, and optimization is easy.

Chapter 7 Gradients and initialization Chapter 6 introduced iterative optimization algorithms. These are general-purpose meth- ods for finding the minimum of a function. In the context of neural networks, they find parameters that minimize the loss so that the model accurately predicts the training outputs from the inputs. The basic approach is to choose initial parameters randomly and then make a series of small changes that decrease the loss on average. Each change is based on the gradient of the loss with respect to the parameters at the current position. This chapter discusses two issues that are specific to neural networks. First, we consider how to calculate the gradients eﬀiciently. This is a serious challenge since the largest models at the time of writing have ∼1012 parameters, and the gradient needs to be computed for every parameter at every iteration of the training algorithm. Second, we consider how to initialize the parameters. If this is not done carefully, the initial losses and their gradients can be extremely large or small. In either case, this impedes the training process.\n",

(C) MIT Press. 7.2 Computing derivatives 97 We also have individual loss terms ℓi, which return the negative log-likelihood of the ground truth label yi given the model prediction f[xi, ϕ] for training input xi. For example, this might be the least squares loss ℓi = (f[xi, ϕ] −yi)2. The total loss is the sum of these terms over the training data: L[ϕ] = I X i=1 ℓi. (7.2) The most commonly used optimization algorithm for training neural networks is stochastic gradient descent (SGD), which updates the parameters as: ϕt+1 ← −ϕt −α X i∈Bt ∂ℓi[ϕt] ∂ϕ , (7.3) where α is the learning rate, and Bt contains the batch indices at iteration t. To compute this update, we need to calculate the derivatives: ∂ℓi ∂βk and ∂ℓi ∂Ωk , (7.4) for the parameters {βk, Ωk} at every layer k ∈{0, 1, . . . , K} and for each index i in Problem 7.1 the batch.

      "│   │   └── Observation 1: Each weight (element of Ωk) multiplies the activation at a source hidden unit and adds the result to a destination hidden unit in the next layer. It follows that the effect of any small change to the weight is amplified or attenuated by the activation at the source hidden unit. Hence, we run the network for each data example in the batch and store the activations of all the hidden units. This is known as the forward pass (figure 7.1). The stored activations will subsequently be used to compute the gradients. Observation 2: A small change in a bias or weight causes a ripple effect of changes through the subsequent network.

The goal is to compute the derivatives of the loss ℓwith respect to each of the weights (arrows) and biases (not shown). In other words, we want to know how a small change to each parameter will affect the loss. Each weight multiplies the hidden unit at its source and contributes the result to the hidden unit at its destination. Consequently, the effects of any small change to the weight will be scaled by the activation of the source hidden unit. For example, the blue weight is applied to the second hidden unit at layer 1; if the activation of this unit doubles, then the effect of a small change to the blue weight will double too. Hence, to compute the derivatives of the weights, we need to calculate and store the activations at the hidden layers. This is known as the forward pass since it involves running the network equations sequentially. unit. This, in turn, changes the values of the hidden units in the subsequent layer, which will change the hidden units in the layer after that, and so on, until a change is made to the model output and, finally, the loss. Hence, to know how changing a parameter modifies the loss, we also need to know how changes to every subsequent hidden layer will, in turn, modify their successor. These same quantities are required when considering other parameters in the same or earlier layers. It follows that we can calculate them once and reuse them. For example, consider computing the effect of a small change in weights that feed into hidden layers h3, h2, and h1, respectively: • To calculate how a small change in a weight or bias feeding into hidden layer h3 modifies the loss, we need to know (i) how a change in layer h3 changes the model output f, and (ii) how a change in this output changes the loss ℓ(figure 7.2a). • To calculate how a small change in a weight or bias feeding into hidden layer h2 modifies the loss, we need to know (i) how a change in layer h2 affects h3, (ii) how h3 changes the model output, and (iii) how this output changes the loss (figure 7.2b). • To calculate how a small change in a weight or bias feeding into hidden layer h1 modifies the loss, we need to know (i) how a change in layer h1 affects layer h2, (ii) how a change in layer h2 affects layer h3, (iii) how layer h3 changes the model output, and (iv) how the model output changes the loss (figure 7.2c).

Proceeding backward through the network in this way to compute the derivatives is known as the backward pass. The ideas behind backpropagation are relatively easy to understand. However, the derivation requires matrix calculus because the bias and weight terms are vectors and matrices, respectively. To help grasp the underlying mechanics, the following section derives backpropagation for a simpler toy model with scalar parameters.

Forward pass: We compute and store the following quantities: f0 = β0 + Ω0xi hk = a[fk−1] k ∈{1, 2, . . . , K} fk = βk + Ωkhk. k ∈{1, 2, . . . , K} (7.23) Backward pass: We start with the derivative ∂ℓi/∂fK of the loss function ℓi with respect to the network output fK and work backward through the network: ∂ℓi ∂βk = ∂ℓi ∂fk k ∈{K, K −1, . . . , 1} ∂ℓi ∂Ωk = ∂ℓi ∂fk hT k k ∈{K, K −1, . . . , 1} ∂ℓi ∂fk−1 = I[fk−1 > 0] ⊙ \u0012 ΩT k ∂ℓi ∂fk \u0013 , k ∈{K, K −1, . . . , 1} (7.24) where ⊙denotes pointwise multiplication, and I[fk−1 > 0] is a vector containing ones where fk−1 is greater than zero and zeros elsewhere. Finally, we compute the derivatives with respect to the first set of biases and weights: ∂ℓi ∂β0 = ∂ℓi ∂f0 ∂ℓi ∂Ω0 = ∂ℓi ∂f0 xT i . (7.25) We calculate these derivatives for every training example in the batch and sum them Problem 7.10 together to retrieve the gradient for the SGD update. Notebook 7.2 Backpropagation Note that the backpropagation algorithm is extremely eﬀicient; the most demanding computational step in both the forward and backward pass is matrix multiplication (by Ω and ΩT , respectively) which only requires additions and multiplications. However, it is not memory eﬀicient; the intermediate values in the forward pass must all be stored, and this can limit the size of the model we can train.\n",

(C) MIT Press. 7.5 Parameter initialization 107 and TensorFlow calculate the derivatives automatically, given the model specification. This is known as algorithmic differentiation. Each functional component (linear transform, ReLU activation, loss function) in the framework knows how to compute its own derivative. For example, the PyTorch ReLU function zout = relu[zin] knows how to compute the derivative of its output zout with respect to its input zin. Similarly, a linear function zout = β + Ωzin knows how to compute the derivatives of the output zout with respect to the input zin and with re- spect to the parameters β and Ω. The algorithmic differentiation framework also knows the sequence of operations in the network and thus has all the information required to perform the forward and backward passes. These frameworks exploit the massive parallelism of modern graphics processing units (GPUs). Computations such as matrix multiplication (which features in both the forward and backward pass) are naturally amenable to parallelization. Moreover, it’s possible to Problem 7.11 perform the forward and backward passes for the entire batch in parallel if the model and intermediate results in the forward pass do not exceed the available memory. Since the training algorithm now processes the entire batch in parallel, the input becomes a multi-dimensional tensor. In this context, a tensor can be considered the generalization of a matrix to arbitrary dimensions. Hence, a vector is a 1D tensor, a matrix is a 2D tensor, and a 3D tensor is a 3D grid of numbers. Until now, the training data have been 1D, so the input for backpropagation would be a 2D tensor where the first dimension indexes the batch element and the second indexes the data dimension. In subsequent chapters, we will encounter more complex structured input data. For example, in models where the input is an RGB image, the original data examples are 3D (height × width × channel). Here, the input to the learning framework would be a 4D tensor, where the extra dimension indexes the batch element.\n",

Consider a deep network with 50 hidden layers and Dh = 100 hidden units per layer. The network has a 100-dimensional input x initialized from a standard normal distribution, a single fixed target y = 0, and a least squares loss function. The bias vectors βk are initialized to zero, and the weight matrices Ωk are initialized with a normal distribution with mean zero and five different variances σ2 Ω∈{0.001, 0.01, 0.02, 0.1, 1.0}. a) Variance of hidden unit activations computed in forward pass as a function of the network layer. For He initialization (σ2 Ω= 2/Dh = 0.02), the variance is stable. However, for larger values, it increases rapidly, and for smaller values, it decreases rapidly (note log scale). b) The variance of the gradients in the backward pass (solid lines) continues this trend; if we initialize with a value larger than 0.02, the magnitude of the gradients increases rapidly as we pass back through the network. If we initialize with a value smaller, then the magnitude decreases. These are known as the exploding gradient and vanishing gradient problems, respectively. This, in turn, implies that if we want the variance σ2 f ′ of the subsequent pre-activations f ′ to be the same as the variance σ2 f of the original pre-activations f during the forward pass, we should set: σ2 Ω= 2 Dh , (7.31) where Dh is the dimension of the original layer to which the weights were applied. This is known as He initialization.\n",

This work is subject to a Creative Commons CC-BY-NC-ND license. (C) MIT Press. Notes 113 computation is eﬀicient, and to this end, the backpropagation algorithm was introduced. Careful parameter initialization is also critical. The magnitudes of the hidden unit activations can either decrease or increase exponentially in the forward pass. The same is true of the gradient magnitudes in the backward pass, where these behaviors are known as the vanishing gradient and exploding gradient problems. Both impede training but can be avoided with appropriate initialization. We’ve now defined the model and the loss function, and we can train a model for a given task. The next chapter discusses how to measure the model performance. Notes Backpropagation: Eﬀicient reuse of partial computations while calculating gradients in com- putational graphs has been repeatedly discovered, including by Werbos (1974), Bryson et al. (1979), LeCun (1985), and Parker (1985). However, the most celebrated description of this idea was by Rumelhart et al. (1985) and Rumelhart et al. (1986), who also coined the term “backpropagation.” This latter work kick-started a new phase of neural network research in the eighties and nineties; for the first time, it was practical to train networks with hidden layers. However, progress stalled due (in retrospect) to a lack of training data, limited computational power, and the use of sigmoid activations. Areas such as natural language processing and com- puter vision did not rely on neural network models until the remarkable image classification results of Krizhevsky et al. (2012) ushered in the modern era of deep learning. The implementation of backpropagation in modern deep learning frameworks such as PyTorch and TensorFlow is an example of reverse-mode algorithmic differentiation. This is distinguished from forward-mode algorithmic differentiation in which the derivatives from the chain rule are accumulated while moving forward through the computational graph (see problem 7.13). Further information about algorithmic differentiation can be found in Griewank & Walther (2008) and Baydin et al. (2018). Initialization: He initialization was first introduced by He et al. (2015). It follows closely from Glorot or Xavier initialization (Glorot & Bengio, 2010), which is very similar but does not consider the effect of the ReLU layer and so differs by a factor of two. Essentially the same method was proposed much earlier by LeCun et al. (2012) but with a slightly different motivation; in this case, sigmoidal activation functions were used, which naturally normalize the range of outputs at each layer, and hence help prevent an exponential increase in the magnitudes of the hidden units. However, if the pre-activations are too large, they fall into the flat regions of the sigmoid function and result in very small gradients. Hence, it is still important to initialize the weights sensibly. Klambauer et al. (2017) introduce the scaled exponential linear unit (SeLU) and show that, within a certain range of inputs, this activation function tends to make the activations in network layers automatically converge to mean zero and unit variance. A completely different approach is to pass data through the network and then normalize by the empirically observed variance. Layer-sequential unit variance initialization (Mishkin & Matas, 2016) is an example of this kind of method, in which the weight matrices are initialized as orthonormal. GradInit (Zhu et al., 2021) randomizes the initial weights and temporarily fixes them while it learns non-negative scaling factors for each weight matrix. These factors are selected to maximize the decrease in the loss for a fixed learning rate subject to a constraint on the maximum gradient norm. Activation normalization or ActNorm adds a learnable scaling and offset parameter after each network layer at each hidden unit. They run an initial batch through the network and then choose the offset and scale so that the mean of the activations is zero and the variance one. After this, these extra parameters are learned as part of the model. Draft: please send errata to udlbookmail@gmail.com. 114 7 Gradients and initialization Closely related to these methods are schemes such as BatchNorm (Ioffe & Szegedy, 2015), in which the network normalizes the variance of each batch as part of its processing at every step. BatchNorm and its variants are discussed in chapter 11. Other initialization schemes have been proposed for specific architectures, including the ConvolutionOrthogonal initializer (Xiao et al., 2018a) for convolutional networks, Fixup (Zhang et al., 2019a) for residual networks, and TFixup (Huang et al., 2020a) and DTFixup (Xu et al., 2021b) for transformers. Reducing memory requirements: Training neural networks is memory intensive. We must store both the model parameters and the pre-activations at the hidden units for every member of the batch during the forward pass. Two methods that decrease memory requirements are gradient checkpointing (Chen et al., 2016a) and micro-batching (Huang et al., 2019). In gradient checkpointing, the activations are only stored every N layers during the forward pass. During the backward pass, the intermediate missing activations are recalculated from the nearest check- point. In this manner, we can drastically reduce the memory requirements at the computational cost of performing the forward pass twice (problem 7.11). In micro-batching, the batch is sub- divided into smaller parts, and the gradient updates are aggregated from each sub-batch before being applied to the network. A completely different approach is to build a reversible network (e.g., Gomez et al., 2017), in which the activations at the previous layer can be computed from the activations at the current one, so there is no need to cache anything during the forward pass (see chapter 16). Sohoni et al. (2019) review approaches to reducing memory requirements. Distributed training: For suﬀiciently large models, the memory requirements or total re- quired time may be too much for a single processor. In this case, we must use distributed training, in which training takes place in parallel across multiple processors. There are several approaches to parallelism. In data parallelism, each processor or node contains a full copy of the model but runs a subset of the batch (see Xing et al., 2015; Li et al., 2020b). The gradients from each node are aggregated centrally and then redistributed back to each node to ensure that the models remain consistent. This is known as synchronous training. The synchronization required to aggregate and redistribute the gradients can be a performance bottleneck, and this leads to the idea of asynchronous training. For example, in the Hogwild! algorithm (Recht et al., 2011), the gradient from a node is used to update a central model whenever it is ready. The updated model is then redistributed to the node. This means that each node may have a slightly different version of the model at any given time, so the gradient updates may be stale; however, it works well in practice. Other decentralized schemes have also been developed. For example, in Zhang et al. (2016a), the individual nodes update one another in a ring structure. Data parallelism methods still assume that the entire model can be held in the memory of a single node. Pipeline model parallelism stores different layers of the network on different nodes and hence does not have this requirement. In a naïve implementation, the first node runs the forward pass for the batch on the first few layers and passes the result to the next node, which runs the forward pass on the next few layers and so on. In the backward pass, the gradients are updated in the opposite order. The obvious disadvantage of this approach is that each machine lies idle for most of the cycle. Various schemes revolving around each node processing micro- batches sequentially have been proposed to reduce this ineﬀiciency (e.g., Huang et al., 2019; Narayanan et al., 2021a). Finally, in tensor model parallelism, computation at a single network layer is distributed across nodes (e.g., Shoeybi et al., 2019). A good overview of distributed training methods can be found in Narayanan et al. (2021b), who combine tensor, pipeline, and data parallelism to train a language model with one trillion parameters on 3072 GPUs.

This chapter considers how to measure the performance of the trained models. With suﬀicient capacity (i.e., number of hidden units), a neural network model will often perform perfectly on the training data. However, this does not necessarily mean it will generalize well to new test data. We will see that the test errors have three distinct causes and that their relative contributions depend on (i) the inherent uncertainty in the task, (ii) the amount of training data, and (iii) the choice of model. The latter dependency raises the issue of hyperparameter search. We discuss how to select both the model hyperparameters (e.g., the number of hidden layers and the number of hidden units in each) and the learning algorithm hyperparameters (e.g., the learning rate and batch size).\n",

To generate I training examples {xi, yi}, the input space x ∈[0, 1] is divided into I equal segments and one sample xi is drawn from a uniform distribution within each segment. The correspond- ing value yi is created by evaluating the function at xi and adding Gaussian noise (gray region shows ±2 standard devia- tions). The test data are generated in the same way. orized the training set but be unable to predict new examples. To estimate the true performance, we need a separate test set of input/output pairs {xi, yi}. To this end, we generate 1000 more examples using the same process. Figure 8.2a also shows the errors for this test data as a function of the training step. These decrease as training proceeds, but only to around 40%. This is better than the chance error rate of 90% error rate but far worse than for the training set; the model has not generalized well to the test data. The test loss (figure 8.2b) decreases for the first 1500 training steps but then increases Notebook 8.1 MNIST-1D performance again. At this point, the test error rate is fairly constant; the model makes the same mistakes but with increasing confidence. This decreases the probability of the correct answers and thus increases the negative log-likelihood. This increasing confidence is a side-effect of the softmax function; the pre-softmax activations are driven to increasingly extreme values to make the probability of the training data approach one (see figure 5.10).\n",

This source of error is insurmount- able for the test data. Note that it does not necessarily limit the training performance; we will likely never see the same input x twice during training, so it is still possible to fit the training data perfectly. Noise may arise because there is a genuine stochastic element to the data generation process, because some of the data are mislabeled, or because there are further explanatory variables that were not observed. In rare cases, noise may be absent; for example, a network might approximate a function that is deterministic but requires significant computation to evaluate. However, noise is usually a fundamental limitation on the possible test performance. Bias A second potential source of error may occur because the model is not flexible enough to fit the true function perfectly. For example, the three-region neural network model cannot exactly describe the quasi-sinusoidal function, even when the parameters are chosen optimally (figure 8.5b). This is known as bias.

This additional source of variability in the fitted function is termed variance (figure 8.5c).

Consider a 1D regression problem where the data generation process has additive noise with vari- ance σ2 (e.g., figure 8.3); we can observe different outputs y for the same input x, so for Appendix C.2 Expectation each x, there is a distribution Pr(y|x) with expected value (mean) µ[x]: µ[x] = Ey[y[x]] = Z y[x]Pr(y|x)dy, (8.1) and fixed noise σ2 = Ey \u0002 (µ[x] −y[x])2\u0003 . Here we have used the notation y[x] to specify that we are considering the output y at a given input position x. Now consider a least squares loss between the model prediction f[x, ϕ] at position x and the observed value y[x] at that position: L[x] = \u0000f[x, ϕ] −y[x] \u00012 (8.2) = \u0010\u0000f[x, ϕ] −µ[x] \u0001 + \u0000µ[x] −y[x] \u0001\u00112 = \u0000f[x, ϕ] −µ[x] \u00012 + 2 \u0000f[x, ϕ]) −µ[x] \u0001\u0000µ[x] −y[x] \u0001 + \u0000µ[x] −y[x] \u00012, where we have both added and subtracted the mean µ[x] of the underlying function in the second line and have expanded out the squared term in the third line. The underlying function is stochastic, so this loss depends on the particular y[x] we observe. The expected loss is: Ey \u0002 L[x] \u0003 = Ey h\u0000f[x, ϕ]−µ[x] \u00012 + 2 \u0000f[x, ϕ]−µ[x] \u0001\u0000µ[x]−y[x] \u0001 + \u0000µ[x]−y[x] \u00012i = \u0000f[x, ϕ]−µ[x] \u00012 + 2 \u0000f[x, ϕ] −µ[x] \u0001\u0000µ[x]−Ey [y[x]] \u0001 + Ey \u0002 (µ[x]−y[x])2\u0003 = \u0000f[x, ϕ]−µ[x] \u00012 + 2 \u0000f[x, ϕ]−µ[x] \u0001 · 0 + Ey h\u0000µ[x]−y[x] \u00012i = \u0000f[x, ϕ] −µ[x] \u00012 + σ2, (8.3) where we have made use of the rules for manipulating expectations. In the second line, we Appendix C.2.1 Expectation rules have distributed the expectation operator and removed it from terms with no dependence on y[x], and in the third line, we note that the second term is zero since Ey[y[x]] = µ[x] by definition. Finally, in the fourth line, we have substituted in the definition of the Draft: please send errata to udlbookmail@gmail.com. 124 8 Measuring performance noise σ2. We can see that the expected loss has been broken down into two terms; the first term is the squared deviation between the model and the true function mean, and the second term is the noise. The first term can be further partitioned into bias and variance. The parameters ϕ of the model f[x, ϕ] depend on the training dataset D = {xi, yi}, so more properly, we should write f [x, ϕ[D]]. The training dataset is a random sample from the data generation process; with a different sample of training data, we would learn different parameter values. The expected model output fµ[x] with respect to all possible datasets D is hence: fµ[x] = ED h f \u0002 x, ϕ[D] \u0003i . (8.4) Returning to the first term of equation 8.3, we add and subtract fµ[x] and expand: \u0000f[x, ϕ[D]]−µ[x] \u00012 (8.5) = \u0010\u0000f[x, ϕ[D]]−fµ[x] \u0001 + \u0000fµ[x] −µ[x] \u0001\u00112 = \u0000f[x, ϕ[D]]−fµ[x] \u00012 + 2 \u0000f[x, ϕ[D]]−fµ[x] \u0001\u0000fµ[x]−µ[x] \u0001 + \u0000fµ[x]−µ[x] \u00012. We then take the expectation with respect to the training dataset D: ED h\u0000f[x, ϕ[D]] −µ[x] \u00012i = ED h\u0000f[x, ϕ[D]] −fµ[x] \u00012i + \u0000fµ[x] −µ[x] \u00012, (8.6) where we have simplified using similar steps as for equation 8.3. Finally, we substitute this result into equation 8.3: ED h Ey[L[x]] i = ED h\u0000f[x, ϕ[D]] −fµ[x] \u00012i | {z } variance + \u0000fµ[x]−µ[x] \u00012 | {z } bias + σ2. |{z} noise (8.7) This equation says that the expected loss after considering the uncertainty in the training data D and the test data y consists of three additive components. The variance is uncertainty in the fitted model due to the particular training dataset we sample. The bias is the systematic deviation of the model from the mean of the function we are modeling. The noise is the inherent uncertainty in the true mapping from input to output. These three sources of error will be present for any task. They combine additively for linear regression with a least squares loss. However, their interaction can be more complex for other types of problems.\n",

For a fixed-size training dataset, the variance term increases as the model capacity increases. Consequently, increasing the model capacity does not necessarily reduce the test error. This is known as the bias-variance trade-off. Figure 8.8 explores this phenomenon. In panels a–c), we fit the simplified three-region model to three different datasets of fifteen points. Although the datasets differ, the final model is much the same; the noise in the dataset roughly averages out in each linear region. In panels d–f), we fit a model with ten regions to the same three datasets. This model has more flexibility, but this is disadvantageous; the model certainly fits the data better, and the training error will be lower, but much of the extra descriptive power is devoted to modeling the noise. This phenomenon is known as overfitting. We’ve seen that as we add capacity to the model, the bias will decrease, but the variance will increase for a fixed-size training dataset. This suggests that there is an optimal capacity where the bias is not too large and the variance is still relatively small. Figure 8.9 shows how these terms vary numerically for the toy model as we increase Notebook 8.2 Bias-variance trade-off the capacity, using the data from figure 8.8. For regression models, the total expected error is the sum of the bias and the variance, and this sum is minimized when the model capacity is four (i.e., with four hidden units and four linear regions).

      "│   │       └──  The discovery of double descent is recent, unexpected, and somewhat puzzling. It results from an interaction of two phenomena. First, the test performance becomes temporarily worse when the model has just enough capacity to memorize the data. Second, the test performance continues to improve with capacity even after the training performance is perfect. The first phenomenon is exactly as predicted by the bias-variance trade-off. The second phenomenon is more confusing; it’s unclear why performance should be better in the over-parameterized regime, given that there are now not even enough training data points to constrain the model parameters uniquely. To understand why performance continues to improve as we add more parameters, note that once the model has enough capacity to drive the training loss to near zero, the model fits the training data almost perfectly. This implies that further capacity Problems 8.4–8.5 cannot help the model fit the training data any better; any change must occur between the training points. The tendency of a model to prioritize one solution over another as it extrapolates between data points is known as its inductive bias. The model’s behavior between data points is critical because, in high-dimensional space, the training data are extremely sparse. The MNIST-1D dataset has 40 dimensions, and we trained with 10,000 examples. If this seems like plenty of data, consider what would happen if we quantized each input dimension into 10 bins. There would be 1040 bins in total, constrained by only 105 examples. Even with this coarse quantization, there will only be one data point in every 1035 bins! The tendency of the volume of high-dimensional space to overwhelm the number of training points is termed the curse of dimensionality. The implication is that problems in high dimensions might look more like figure 8.11a; there are small regions of the input space where we observe data with significant gaps between them. The putative explanation for double descent is that as we add capacity to the model, it interpolates between the nearest data points increasingly smoothly. In the absence of information about what happens between the training points, assuming smoothness is sensible and will probably generalize reasonably to new data.

The training loss decreases to zero as the number of parameters approaches the number of training examples (vertical dashed line). The test error does not show the expected bias-variance trade-off but continues to decrease even after the model has memorized the dataset. b) The same exper- iment is repeated with noisier training data. Again, the training error reduces to zero, although it now takes almost as many parameters as training points to memorize the dataset. The test error shows the predicted bias/variance trade-off; it decreases as the capacity increases but then increases again as we near the point where the training data is exactly memorized. However, it subsequently decreases again and ultimately reaches a better performance level. This is known as double descent. Depending on the loss, the model, and the amount of noise in the data, the double descent pattern can be seen to a greater or lesser degree across many datasets. c) Results on MNIST (without label noise) with shallow neural network from Belkin et al.

However, unlike in this figure, it is not obliged to. This argument is plausible. It’s certainly true that as we add more capacity to the model, it will have the capability to create smoother functions. Figures 8.11b–f show the smoothest possible functions that still pass through the data points as we increase the number of hidden units. When the number of parameters is very close to the number of training data examples (figure 8.11b), the model is forced to contort itself to fit the training data exactly, resulting in erratic predictions. This explains why the peak in the double descent curve is so pronounced. As we add more hidden units, the model has the ability to construct smoother functions that are likely to generalize better to new data. However, this does not explain why over-parameterized models should produce smooth functions. Figure 8.12 shows three functions that can be created by the simplified model with 50 hidden units. In each case, the model fits the data exactly, so the loss is zero. If the modern regime of double descent is explained by increasing smoothness, then what exactly is encouraging this smoothness?

However, we might expect the smooth curve in panel (a) to generalize much better to new data than the erratic curves in panels (b) and (c). Any factor that biases a model toward a subset of the solutions with a similar training loss is known as a regularizer. It is thought that the initialization and/or fitting of neural networks have an implicit regularizing effect. Consequently, in the over-parameterized regime, more reasonable solutions, such as that in panel (a), are encouraged. The answer to this question is uncertain, but there are two likely possibilities. First, the network initialization may encourage smoothness, and the model never departs from the sub-domain of smooth function during the training process. Second, the training algorithm may somehow “prefer” to converge to smooth functions. Any factor that biases a solution toward a subset of equivalent solutions is known as a regularizer, so one possibility is that the training algorithm acts as an implicit regularizer (see section 9.2).\n",

(C) MIT Press. 8.6 Summary 133 Hyperparameters are typically chosen empirically; we train many models with differ- ent hyperparameters on the same training set, measure their performance, and retain the best model. However, we do not measure their performance on the test set; this would admit the possibility that these hyperparameters just happen to work well for the test set but don’t generalize to further data. Instead, we introduce a third dataset known as a validation set. For every choice of hyperparameters, we train the associated model using the training set and evaluate performance on the validation set. Finally, we select the model that worked best on the validation set and measure its performance on the test set. In principle, this should give a reasonable estimate of the true performance. The hyperparameter space is generally smaller than the parameter space but still too large to try every combination exhaustively. Unfortunately, many hyperparameters are discrete (e.g., the number of hidden layers), and others may be conditional on one another (e.g., we only need to specify the number of hidden units in the tenth hidden layer if there are ten or more layers). Hence, we cannot rely on gradient descent methods as we did for learning the model parameters. Hyperparameter optimization algorithms intelligently sample the space of hyperparameters, contingent on previous results. This procedure is computationally expensive since we must train an entire model and measure the validation performance for each combination of hyperparameters.\n",

For classification problems, there are some counter-intuitive Draft: please send errata to udlbookmail@gmail.com. 134 8 Measuring performance predictions; for example, if the model is biased toward selecting the wrong class in a region of the input space, then increasing the variance can improve the classification rate as this pushes some of the predictions over the threshold to be classified correctly. Cross-validation: We saw that it is typical to divide the data into three parts: training data (which is used to learn the model parameters), validation data (which is used to choose the hyperparameters), and test data (which is used to estimate the final performance). This approach is known as cross-validation. However, this division may cause problems where the total number of data examples is limited; if the number of training examples is comparable to the model capacity, then the variance will be large. One way to mitigate this problem is to use k-fold cross-validation. The training and validation data are partitioned into K disjoint subsets. For example, we might divide these data into five parts. We train with four and validate with the fifth for each of the five permutations and choose the hyperparameters based on the average validation performance. The final test performance is assessed using the average of the predictions from the five models with the best hyperparameters on an entirely different test set. There are many variations of this idea, but all share the general goal of using a larger proportion of the data to train the model, thereby reducing variance. Capacity: We have used the term capacity informally to mean the number of parameters or hidden units in the model (and hence indirectly, the ability of the model to fit functions of increasing complexity). The representational capacity of a model describes the space of possible functions it can construct when we consider all possible parameter values. When we take into account the fact that an optimization algorithm may not be able to reach all of these solutions, what is left is the effective capacity. The Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) dimension (Vapnik & Chervonenkis, 1971) is a more formal measure of capacity. It is the largest number of training examples that a binary classifier can label arbitrarily. Bartlett et al. (2019) derive upper and lower bounds for the VC dimension in terms of the number of layers and weights. An alternative measure of capacity is the Rademacher complexity, which is the expected empirical performance of a classification model (with optimal parameters) for data with random labels. Neyshabur et al. (2017) derive a lower bound on the generalization error in terms of the Rademacher complexity. Double descent: The term “double descent” was coined by Belkin et al. (2019), who demon- strated that the test error decreases again in the over-parameterized regime for two-layer neural networks and random features. They also claimed that this occurs in decision trees, although Buschjäger & Morik (2021) subsequently provided evidence to the contrary. Nakkiran et al. (2021) show that double descent occurs for various modern datasets (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, IWSLT’14 de-en), architectures (CNNs, ResNets, transformers), and optimizers (SGD, Adam). The phenomenon is more pronounced when noise is added to the target labels (Nakkiran et al., 2021) and when some regularization techniques are used (Ishida et al., 2020). Nakkiran et al. (2021) also provide empirical evidence that test performance depends on effective model capacity (the largest number of samples for which a given model and training method can achieve zero training error). At this point, the model starts to devote its efforts to interpolating smoothly. As such, the test performance depends not just on the model but also on the training algorithm and length of training. They observe the same pattern when they study a model with fixed capacity and increase the number of training iterations. They term this epoch-wise double descent. This phenomenon has been modeled by Pezeshki et al. (2022) in terms of different features in the model being learned at different speeds. Double descent makes the rather strange prediction that adding training data can sometimes worsen test performance.

If we increase the training data to match the model capacity, we will now be in the critical region of the new test error curve, and the test loss may increase. Bubeck & Sellke (2021) prove that overparameterization is necessary to interpolate data smoothly in high dimensions. They demonstrate a trade-off between the number of parameters and the Appendix B.1.1 Lipschitz constant Lipschitz constant of a model (the fastest the output can change for a small input change). A review of the theory of over-parameterized machine learning can be found in Dar et al. (2021). Curse of dimensionality: As dimensionality increases, the volume of space grows so fast that the amount of data needed to densely sample it increases exponentially. This phenomenon is known as the curse of dimensionality. High-dimensional space has many unexpected properties, and caution should be used when trying to reason about it based on low-dimensional exam- ples. This book visualizes many aspects of deep learning in one or two dimensions, but these visualizations should be treated with healthy skepticism. Surprising properties of high-dimensional spaces include: (i) Two randomly sampled data points from a standard normal distribution are very close to orthogonal to one another (relative to Problems 8.6–8.9 the origin) with high likelihood. (ii) The distance from the origin of samples from a standard normal distribution is roughly constant. (iii) Most of a volume of a high-dimensional sphere (hypersphere) is adjacent to its surface (a common metaphor is that most of the volume of a high- dimensional orange is in the peel, not in the pulp). (iv) If we place a unit-diameter hypersphere inside a hypercube with unit-length sides, then the hypersphere takes up a decreasing proportion of the volume of the cube as the dimension increases. Since the volume of the cube is fixed at Notebook 8.4 High-dimensional spaces size one, this implies that the volume of a high-dimensional hypersphere becomes close to zero. (v) For random points drawn from a uniform distribution in a high-dimensional hypercube, the ratio of the Euclidean distance between the nearest and furthest points becomes close to one. For further information, consult Beyer et al. (1999) and Aggarwal et al. (2001). Real-world performance: In this chapter, we argued that model performance could be evalu- ated using a held-out test set. However, the result won’t be indicative of real-world performance if the statistics of the test set don’t match those of real-world data. Moreover, the statistics of real-world data may change over time, causing the model to become increasingly stale and performance to decrease. This is known as data drift and means that deployed models must be carefully monitored. There are three main reasons why real-world performance may be worse than the test perfor- mance implies. First, the statistics of the input data x may change; we may now be observing parts of the function that were sparsely sampled or not sampled at all during training. This is known as covariate shift. Second, the statistics of the output data y may change; if some output values are infrequent during training, then the model may learn not to predict these in ambiguous situations and will make mistakes if they are more common in the real world. This is known as prior shift. Third, the relationship between input and output may change. This is known as concept shift. These issues are discussed in Moreno-Torres et al. (2012). Hyperparameter search: Finding the best hyperparameters is a challenging optimization task. Testing a single configuration of hyperparameters is expensive; we must train an entire model and measure its performance. We have no easy way to access the derivatives (i.e., how performance changes when we make a small change to a hyperparameter). Moreover, many of the hyperparameters are discrete, so we cannot use gradient descent methods. There are multiple local minima and no way to tell if we are close to the global minimum. The noise level is high since each training/validation cycle uses a stochastic training algorithm; we expect different results if we train a model twice with the same hyperparameters. Finally, some variables are conditional and only exist if others are set. For example, the number of hidden units in the third hidden layer is only relevant if we have at least three hidden layers. Draft: please send errata to udlbookmail@gmail.com. 136 8 Measuring performance A simple approach is to sample the space randomly (Bergstra & Bengio, 2012). However, for continuous variables, it is better to build a model of performance as a function of the hyperparameters and the uncertainty in this function. This can be exploited to test where the uncertainty is great (explore the space) or home in on regions where performance looks promising (exploit previous knowledge). Bayesian optimization is a framework based on Gaussian processes that does just this, and its application to hyperparameter search is described in Snoek et al. (2012). The Beta-Bernoulli bandit (see Lattimore & Szepesvári, 2020) is a roughly equivalent model for describing uncertainty in results due to discrete variables. The sequential model-based configuration (SMAC) algorithm (Hutter et al., 2011) can cope with continuous, discrete, and conditional parameters. The basic approach is to use a random forest to model the objective function where the mean of the tree predictions is the best guess about the objective function, and their variance represents the uncertainty. A completely different approach that can also cope with combinations of continuous, discrete, and conditional param- eters is Tree-Parzen Estimators (Bergstra et al., 2011). The previous methods modeled the probability of the model performance given the hyperparameters. In contrast, the Tree-Parzen estimator models the probability of the hyperparameters given the model performance. Hyperband (Li et al., 2017b) is a multi-armed bandit strategy for hyperparameter optimization. It assumes that there are computationally cheap but approximate ways to measure performance (e.g., by not training to completion) and that these can be associated with a budget (e.g., by training for a fixed number of iterations). A number of random configurations are sampled and run until the budget is used up. Then the best fraction η of runs is kept, and the budget is multiplied by 1/η. This is repeated until the maximum budget is reached. This approach has the advantage of eﬀiciency; for bad configurations, it does not need to run the experiment to the end. However, each sample is just chosen randomly, which is ineﬀicient. The BOHB algorithm (Falkner et al., 2018) combines the eﬀiciency of Hyperband with the more sensible choice of hyperparameters from Tree Parzen estimators to construct an even better method.

Chapter 9 Regularization Chapter 8 described how to measure model performance and identified that there could be a significant performance gap between the training and test data. Possible reasons for this discrepancy include: (i) the model describes statistical peculiarities of the training data that are not representative of the true mapping from input to output (overfitting), and (ii) the model is unconstrained in areas with no training examples, leading to sub- optimal predictions. This chapter discusses regularization techniques. These are a family of methods that reduce the generalization gap between training and test performance. Strictly speaking, regularization involves adding explicit terms to the loss function that favor certain pa- rameter choices. However, in machine learning, this term is commonly used to refer to any strategy that improves generalization. We start by considering regularization in its strictest sense. Then we show how the stochastic gradient descent algorithm itself favors certain solutions. This is known as implicit regularization. Following this, we consider a set of heuristic methods that improve test performance. These include early stopping, ensembling, dropout, label smoothing, and transfer learning.\n",

      "│   │       └──  This discussion has sidestepped the question of which solutions the regularization term should penalize (or equivalently that the prior should favor). Since neural networks are used in an extremely broad range of applications, these can only be very generic pref- erences. The most commonly used regularization term is the L2 norm, which penalizes the sum of the squares of the parameter values: ˆ ϕ = argmin ϕ   I X i=1 ℓi[xi, yi] + λ X j ϕ2 j  , (9.5) where j indexes the parameters. This is also referred to as Tikhonov regularization or Problems 9.1–9.2 ridge regression, or (when applied to matrices) Frobenius norm regularization. For neural networks, L2 regularization is usually applied to the weights but not the biases and is hence referred to as a weight decay term. The effect is to encourage smaller weights, so the output function is smoother. To see this, consider that the output prediction is a weighted sum of the activations at the last hidden layer. If the Notebook 9.1 L2 regularization weights have a smaller magnitude, the output will vary less. The same logic applies to the computation of the pre-activations at the last hidden layer and so on, progressing backward through the network. In the limit, if we forced all the weights to be zero, the network would produce a constant output determined by the final bias parameter. Figure 9.2 shows the effect of fitting the simplified network from figure 8.4 with weight decay and different values of the regularization coeﬀicient λ. When λ is small, it has little effect. However, as λ increases, the fit to the data becomes less accurate, and the function becomes smoother. This might improve the test performance for two reasons: • If the network is overfitting, then adding the regularization term means that the network must trade off slavish adherence to the data against the desire to be smooth. One way to think about this is that the error due to variance reduces (the model no longer needs to pass through every data point) at the cost of increased bias (the model can only describe smooth functions). • When the network is over-parameterized, some of the extra model capacity de- scribes areas with no training data. Here, the regularization term will favor func- tions that smoothly interpolate between the nearby points. This is reasonable behavior in the absence of knowledge about the true function.

This doesn’t change the position of the minima where the gradients are zero anyway. However, it changes the effective loss function elsewhere and modifies the optimization trajectory, which potentially converges to a different minimum.

(9.10) Equation 9.9 reveals an extra regularization term, which corresponds to the variance of the gradients of the batch losses Lb. In other words, SGD implicitly favors places where the gradients are stable (where all the batches agree on the slope). Once more, this modifies the trajectory of the optimization process (figure 9.4) but does not necessarily change the position of the global minimum; if the model is over-parameterized, then it may fit all the training data exactly, so all of these gradient terms will all be zero at the global minimum. SGD generalizes better than gradient descent, and smaller batch sizes generally per- form better than larger ones (figure 9.5b). One possible explanation is that the inherent randomness allows the algorithm to reach different parts of the loss function. However, Notebook 9.2 Implicit regularization it’s also possible that some or all of this performance increase is due to implicit regular- ization; this encourages solutions where all the data fits well (so the batch variance is small) rather than solutions where some of the data fit extremely well and other data less well (perhaps with the same overall loss, but with larger batch variance). The former solutions are likely to generalize better.\n",

This can reduce overfitting if the model has already captured the coarse shape of the underlying function but has not yet had time to overfit to the noise (figure 9.6). One way of thinking about this is that since the weights are initialized to small values (see section 7.5), they simply don’t have time to become large, so early stopping has a similar effect to explicit L2 regularization. A different view is that early stopping reduces the effective model complexity. Hence, we move back down the bias/variance trade-off curve from the critical region, and performance improves (see figures 8.9 and 8.10). Early stopping has a single hyperparameter, the number of steps after which learning is terminated. As usual, this is chosen empirically using a validation set (section 8.5). However, for early stopping, the hyperparameter can be selected without the need to train multiple models. The model is trained once, the performance on the validation set is monitored every T iterations, and the associated models are stored.

This technique reliably improves test performance at the cost of training and storing multiple models and performing inference multiple times. The models can be combined by taking the mean of the outputs (for regression problems) or the mean of the pre-softmax activations (for classification problems). The assumption is that model errors are independent and will cancel out. Alternatively, we can take the median of the outputs (for regression problems) or the most frequent predicted class (for classification problems) to make the predictions more robust. One way to train different models is just to use different random initializations. This may help in regions of input space far from the training data. Here, the fitted function Notebook 9.3 Ensembling is relatively unconstrained, and different models may produce different predictions, so the average of several models may generalize better than any single model.

This makes the network less dependent on any given hidden unit and encourages the weights to have smaller magnitudes so that the change in the function due to the presence or absence of the hidden unit is reduced. This technique has the positive benefit that it can eliminate undesirable “kinks” in the function that are far from the training data and don’t affect the loss.

Finally, the third unit cancels out this decrease and returns the curve to its original trajectory. These three units conspire to make an undesirable local change in the function. This will not change the training loss but is unlikely to generalize well. When several units conspire in this way, eliminating one (as would happen in dropout) causes a considerable change to the output function that is propagated to the half-space where that unit was active (figure 9.9b). A subsequent gradient descent step will attempt to compensate for the change that this induces, and such dependencies will be eliminated over time. The overall effect is that large unnecessary changes between training data points are gradually removed even though they contribute nothing to the loss (figure 9.9). At test time, we can run the network as usual with all the hidden units active; however, the network now has more hidden units than it was trained with at any given iteration, so we multiply the weights by one minus the dropout probability to compensate. This is known as the weight scaling inference rule. A different approach to inference is to use Monte Carlo dropout, in which we run the network multiple times with different random subsets of units clamped to zero (as in training) and combine the results. This is closely related to ensembling in that every random version of the network is a different model; however, we do not have to train or store multiple networks here.

This leads to the idea of applying noise to other parts of the network during training to make the final model more robust. One option is to add noise to the input data; this smooths out the learned function Problem 9.3 (figure 9.10). For regression problems, it can be shown to be equivalent to adding a regularizing term that penalizes the derivatives of the network’s output with respect to its input. An extreme variant is adversarial training, in which the optimization algorithm actively searches for small perturbations of the input that cause large changes to the output. These can be thought of as worst-case additive noise vectors. A second possibility is to add noise to the weights. This encourages the network to make sensible predictions even for small perturbations of the weights. The result is that the training converges to local minima in the middle of wide, flat regions, where changing the individual weights does not matter much. Finally, we can perturb the labels. The maximum-likelihood criterion for multiclass classification aims to predict the correct class with absolute certainty (equation 5.24). To this end, the final network activations (i.e., before the softmax function) are pushed to very large values for the correct class and very small values for the wrong classes.

This formulation of implicit regularization was developed by Barrett & Dherin (2021) and extended to stochastic gradient descent by Smith et al. (2021). Smith et al. (2020) and others have shown that stochastic gradient descent with small or moderate batch sizes outperforms full batch gradient descent on the test set, and this may in part be due to implicit regularization. Relatedly, Jastrzębski et al. (2021) and Cohen et al. (2021) both show that using a large learn- ing rate reduces the tendency of typical optimization trajectories to move to “sharper” parts of the loss function (i.e., where at least one direction has high curvature). This implicit regular- ization effect of large learning rates can be approximated by penalizing the trace of the Fisher Information Matrix, which is closely related to penalizing the gradient norm in equation 9.20 (Jastrzębski et al., 2021). Early stopping: Bishop (1995) and Sjöberg & Ljung (1995) argued that early stopping limits the effective solution space that the training procedure can explore; given that the weights are initialized to small values, this leads to the idea that early stopping helps prevent the weights from getting too large. Goodfellow et al. (2016) show that under a quadratic approximation of the loss function with parameters initialized to zero, early stopping is equivalent to L2 reg- ularization in gradient descent. The effective regularization weight λ is approximately 1/(τα) where α is the learning rate, and τ is the early stopping time.

The models can be combined by averaging their predictions, weighting the predictions, or stacking (Wolpert, 1992), in which the results are combined using another machine learning model. Lakshminarayanan et al. (2017) showed that averaging the output of independently trained networks can improve accuracy, calibration, and robustness. Conversely, Frankle et al. (2020) showed that if we average together the weights to make one model, the network fails. Fort et al. (2019) compared ensembling solutions that resulted from different initializations with ensembling solutions that were generated from the same original model. For example, in the latter case, they consider exploring around the solution in a limited subspace to find other Appendix B.3.6 Subspaces good nearby points. They found that both techniques provide complementary benefits but that genuine ensembling from different random starting points provides a bigger improvement. An eﬀicient way of ensembling is to combine models from intermediate stages of training. To this end, Izmailov et al. (2018) introduce stochastic weight averaging, in which the model weights are sampled at different time steps and averaged together. As the name suggests, snapshot ensembles (Huang et al., 2017a) also store the models from different time steps and average their predictions. The diversity of these models can be improved by cyclically increasing and decreasing the learning rate. Garipov et al. (2018) observed that different minima of the loss function are often connected by a low-energy path (i.e., a path with a low loss everywhere along it). Motivated by this observation, they developed a method that explores low-energy regions around an initial solution to provide diverse models without retraining. This is known as fast geometric ensembling. A review of ensembling methods can be found in Ganaie et al. (2022). Dropout: Dropout was first introduced by Hinton et al. (2012b) and Srivastava et al. (2014). Dropout is applied at the level of hidden units. Dropping a hidden unit has the same effect as temporarily setting all the incoming and outgoing weights and the bias to zero. Wan et al. (2013) generalized dropout by randomly setting individual weights to zero. Gal & Ghahramani (2016) and Kendall & Gal (2017) proposed Monte Carlo dropout, in which inference is computed with several dropout patterns, and the results are averaged together. Gal & Ghahramani (2016) argued that this could be interpreted as approximating Bayesian inference. Dropout is equivalent to applying multiplicative Bernoulli noise to the hidden units. Similar benefits derive from using other distributions, including the normal (Srivastava et al., 2014; Shen et al., 2017), uniform (Shen et al., 2017), and beta distributions (Liu et al., 2019b). Adding noise: Bishop (1995) and An (1996) added Gaussian noise to the network inputs to improve performance. Bishop (1995) showed that this is equivalent to weight decay. An (1996) also investigated adding noise to the weights. DeVries & Taylor (2017a) added Gaussian noise to the hidden units. The randomized ReLU (Xu et al., 2015) applies noise in a different way by making the activation functions stochastic. Label smoothing: Label smoothing was introduced by Szegedy et al. (2016) for image classi- fication but has since been shown to be helpful in speech recognition (Chorowski & Jaitly, 2017), machine translation (Vaswani et al., 2017), and language modeling (Pereyra et al., 2017). The precise mechanism by which label smoothing improves test performance isn’t well understood, although Müller et al. (2019a) show that it improves the calibration of the predicted output probabilities. A closely related technique is DisturbLabel (Xie et al., 2016), in which a certain percentage of the labels in each batch are randomly switched at each training iteration. Finding wider minima: It is thought that wider minima generalize better (see figure 20.11). Here, the exact values of the weights are less important, so performance should be robust to errors in their estimates. One of the reasons that applying noise to parts of the network during training is effective is that it encourages the network to be indifferent to their exact values. Chaudhari et al. (2019) developed a variant of SGD that biases the optimization toward flat minima, which they call entropy SGD. The idea is to incorporate local entropy as a term in the loss function. In practice, this takes the form of one SGD-like update within another. Keskar This work is subject to a Creative Commons CC-BY-NC-ND license. (C) MIT Press. Notes 159 et al. (2017) showed that SGD finds wider minima as the batch size is reduced. This may be because of the batch variance term that results from implicit regularization by SGD. Ishida et al. (2020) use a technique named flooding, in which they intentionally prevent the training loss from becoming zero. This encourages the solution to perform a random walk over the loss landscape and drift into a flatter area with better generalization. Bayesian approaches: For some models, including the simplified neural network model in figure 9.11, the Bayesian predictive distribution can be computed in closed form (see Bishop, 2006; Prince, 2012). For neural networks, the posterior distribution over the parameters can- not be represented in closed form and must be approximated. The two main approaches are variational Bayes (Hinton & van Camp, 1993; MacKay, 1995; Barber & Bishop, 1997; Blundell et al., 2015), in which the posterior is approximated by a simpler tractable distribution, and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, which approximate the distribution by drawing a set of samples (Neal, 1995; Welling & Teh, 2011; Chen et al., 2014; Ma et al., 2015; Li et al., 2016a). The generation of samples can be integrated into SGD, and this is known as stochas- tic gradient MCMC (see Ma et al., 2015). It has recently been discovered that “cooling” the posterior distribution over the parameters (making it sharper) improves predictions from these models (Wenzel et al., 2020a), but this is not currently fully understood (see Noci et al., 2021). Transfer learning: Transfer learning for visual tasks works extremely well (Sharif Razavian et al., 2014) and has supported rapid progress in computer vision, including the original AlexNet results (Krizhevsky et al., 2012). Transfer learning has also impacted natural language process- ing (NLP), where many models are based on pre-trained features from the BERT model (Devlin et al., 2019). More information can be found in Zhuang et al. (2020) and Yang et al. (2020b). Self-supervised learning: Self-supervised learning techniques for images have included in- painting masked image regions (Pathak et al., 2016), predicting the relative position of patches in an image (Doersch et al., 2015), re-arranging permuted image tiles back into their original configuration (Noroozi & Favaro, 2016), colorizing grayscale images (Zhang et al., 2016b), and transforming rotated images back to their original orientation (Gidaris et al., 2018). In Sim- CLR (Chen et al., 2020c), a network is learned that maps versions of the same image that have been photometrically and geometrically transformed to the same representation while re- pelling versions of different images, with the goal of becoming indifferent to irrelevant image transformations. Jing & Tian (2020) present a survey of self-supervised learning in images. Self-supervised learning in NLP can be based on predicting masked words(Devlin et al., 2019), predicting the next word in a sentence (Radford et al., 2019; Brown et al., 2020), or predicting whether two sentences follow one another (Devlin et al., 2019). In automatic speech recognition, the Wav2Vec model (Schneider et al., 2019) aims to distinguish an original audio sample from one where 10ms of audio has been swapped out from elsewhere in the clip. Self-supervision has also been applied to graph neural networks (chapter 13). Tasks include recovering masked features (You et al., 2020) and recovering the adjacency structure of the graph (Kipf & Welling, 2016). Liu et al. (2023a) review self-supervised learning for graph models. Data augmentation: Data augmentation for images dates back to at least LeCun et al. (1998) and contributed to the success of AlexNet (Krizhevsky et al., 2012), in which the dataset was increased by a factor of 2048. Image augmentation approaches include geometric transfor- mations, changing or manipulating the color space, noise injection, and applying spatial filters. More elaborate techniques include randomly mixing images (Inoue, 2018; Summers & Dinneen, 2019), randomly erasing parts of the image (Zhong et al., 2020), style transfer (Jackson et al., 2019), and randomly swapping image patches (Kang et al., 2017). In addition, many studies have used generative adversarial networks or GANs (see chapter 15) to produce novel but plau- sible data examples (e.g., Calimeri et al., 2017). In other cases, the data have been augmented with adversarial examples (Goodfellow et al., 2015a), which are minor perturbations of the training data that cause the example to be misclassified. A review of data augmentation for images can be found in Shorten & Khoshgoftaar (2019). Draft: please send errata to udlbookmail@gmail.com. 160 9 Regularization Augmentation methods for acoustic data include pitch shifting, time stretching, dynamic range compression, and adding random noise (e.g., Abeßer et al., 2017; Salamon & Bello, 2017; Xu et al., 2015; Lasseck, 2018), as well as mixing data pairs (Zhang et al., 2017c; Yun et al., 2019), masking features (Park et al., 2019), and using GANs to generate new data (Mun et al., 2017). Augmentation for speech data includes vocal tract length perturbation (Jaitly & Hinton, 2013; Kanda et al., 2013), style transfer (Gales, 1998; Ye & Young, 2004), adding noise (Hannun et al., 2014), and synthesizing speech (Gales et al., 2009). Augmentation methods for text include adding noise at a character level by switching, deleting, and inserting letters (Belinkov & Bisk, 2018; Feng et al., 2020), or by generating adversarial examples (Ebrahimi et al., 2018), using common spelling mistakes (Coulombe, 2018), randomly swapping or deleting words (Wei & Zou, 2019), using synonyms (Kolomiyets et al., 2011), altering adjectives (Li et al., 2017c), passivization (Min et al., 2020), using generative models to create new data (Qiu et al., 2020), and round-trip translation to another language and back (Aiken & Park, 2010). Augmentation methods for text are reviewed by Bayer et al. (2022).

How- ever, these chapters only considered fully connected networks with a single path from input to output. Chapters 10–13 introduce more specialized network components with sparser connections, shared weights, and parallel processing paths. This chapter de- scribes convolutional layers, which are mainly used for processing image data. Images have three properties that suggest the need for specialized model architec- ture. First, they are high-dimensional. A typical image for a classification task contains 224×224 RGB values (i.e., 150,528 input dimensions). Hidden layers in fully connected networks are generally larger than the input size, so even for a shallow network, the number of weights would exceed 150, 5282, or 22 billion. This poses obvious practical problems in terms of the required training data, memory, and computation. Second, nearby image pixels are statistically related. However, fully connected net- works have no notion of “nearby” and treat the relationship between every input equally. If the pixels of the training and test images were randomly permuted in the same way, the network could still be trained with no practical difference. Third, the interpretation of an image is stable under geometric transformations. An image of a tree is still an image of a tree if we shift it leftwards by a few pixels. However, this shift changes every input to the network. Hence, a fully connected model must learn the patterns of pixels that signify a tree separately at every position, which is clearly ineﬀicient. Convolutional layers process each local image region independently, using parameters shared across the whole image. They use fewer parameters than fully connected layers, exploit the spatial relationships between nearby pixels, and don’t have to re-learn the interpretation of the pixels at every position. A network predominantly consisting of convolutional layers is known as a convolutional neural network or CNN.\n",

(10.1) In other words, the output of the function f[x] is the same regardless of the transfor- mation t[x]. Networks for image classification should be invariant to geometric trans- formations of the image (figure 10.1a–b). The network f[x] should identify an image as containing the same object, even if it has been translated, rotated, flipped, or warped. A function f[x] of an image x is equivariant or covariant to a transformation t[x] if: f \u0002 t[x] \u0003 = t \u0002 f[x] \u0003 . (10.2) In other words, f[x] is equivariant to the transformation t[x] if its output changes in the same way under the transformation as the input. Networks for per-pixel image segmentation should be equivariant to transformations (figure 10.1c–f); if the image is translated, rotated, or flipped, the network f[x] should return a segmentation that has been transformed in the same way.

They also typically include pooling mechanisms that induce partial invariance to translation. For clarity of exposition, we first consider convolutional net- works for 1D data, which are easier to visualize.

The image is treated as a 2D input with three channels corresponding to the red, green, and blue components. With a 3×3 kernel, each pre-activation in the first hidden layer is computed by pointwise multiplying the 3×3×3 kernel weights with the 3×3 RGB image patch centered at the same position, summing, and adding the bias. To calculate all the pre-activations in the hidden layer, we “slide” the kernel over the image in both horizontal and vertical directions. The output is a 2D layer of hidden units. To create multiple output channels, we would repeat this process with multiple kernels, resulting in a 3D tensor of hidden units at hidden layer H1. can sample every other position. When we use a stride of two, we effectively apply this Problem 10.15 method simultaneously with the convolution operation (figure 10.11a). Second, max pooling retains the maximum of the 2×2 input values (figure 10.11b). This induces some invariance to translation; if the input is shifted by one pixel, many of these maximum values remain the same. Finally, mean pooling or average pooling averages the inputs.

This contains 1,281,167 training images, 50,000 validation images, and 100,000 test images, and every image is labeled as belonging to one of 1000 possible categories. Most methods reshape the input images to a standard size; in a typical system, the input x to the network is a 224×224 RGB image, and the output is a probability distribution over the 1000 classes. The task is challenging; there are a large number of classes, and they exhibit considerable variation (figure 10.15).

Five years later, the best deep learning models eclipsed human performance. In 2012, AlexNet was the first convolutional network to perform well on this task.

This system achieved a 16.4% top-5 error rate and a 38.1% top-1 error rate. At the time, this was an enormous leap forward in performance at a task considered far beyond the capabilities of contemporary methods. This result revealed the potential of deep learning and kick-started the modern era of AI research. The VGG network was also targeted at classification in the ImageNet task and achieved a considerably better performance of 6.8% top-5 error rate and a 23.7% top-1 error rate. This network is similarly composed of a series of interspersed convolutional and max pooling layers, where the spatial size of the representation gradually decreases, but the number of channels increase.

The final convolutional layer is of size 7×7 and has 1024 channels. This is reshaped to a vector, and a fully connected layer maps it to 4096 values. One further fully connected layer maps this representation to the output. The output values encode which class is present at each of a 7×7 grid of locations (figure 10.18a–b). For each location, the output values also encode a fixed number of bounding boxes. Five parameters define each box: the x- and y-positions of the center, the height and width of the box, and the confidence of the prediction (figure 10.18c). The confidence estimates the overlap between the predicted and ground truth bound- ing boxes. The system is trained using momentum, weight decay, dropout, and data augmentation. Transfer learning is employed; the network is initially trained on the ImageNet classification task and is then fine-tuned for object detection. After the network is run, a heuristic process is used to remove rectangles with low confidence and to suppress predicted bounding boxes that correspond to the same object so only the most confident one is retained.

      "│   │       └──  The goal of semantic segmentation is to assign a label to each pixel according to the object that it belongs to or no label if that pixel does not correspond to anything in the training database. An early network for semantic segmentation is depicted in figure 10.19. The input is a 224×224 RGB image, and the output is a 224×224×21 array that contains the probability of each of 21 possible classes at each position. The first part of the network is a smaller version of VGG (figure 10.17) that contains thirteen rather than sixteen convolutional layers and downsizes the representation to size 14×14. There is then one more max pooling operation, followed by two fully connected layers that map to two 1D representations of size 4096. These layers do not represent spatial position but instead, combine information from across the whole image. Here, the architecture diverges from VGG. Another fully connected layer reconsti- tutes the representation into 7×7 spatial positions and 512 channels. This is followed This work is subject to a Creative Commons CC-BY-NC-ND license.

The input is a 224×224 image, which is passed through a version of the VGG network and even- tually transformed into a representation of size 4096 using a fully connected layer. This contains information about the entire image. This is then reformed into a representation of size 7×7 using another fully connected layer, and the image is upsampled and deconvolved (transposed convolutions without upsampling) in a mirror image of the VGG network. The output is a 224×224×21 representation that gives the output probabilities for the 21 classes at each position. by a series of max unpooling layers (see figure 10.12b) and deconvolution layers. These are transposed convolutions (see figure 10.13) but in 2D and without the upsampling. Finally, there is a 1×1 convolution to create 21 channels representing the possible classes and a softmax operation at each spatial position to map the activations to class proba- bilities. The downsampling side of the network is sometimes referred to as an encoder, and the upsampling side as a decoder, so networks of this type are sometimes called encoder-decoder networks or hourglass networks due to their shape. The final segmentation is generated using a heuristic method that greedily searches for the class that is most represented and infers its region, taking into account the probabilities but also encouraging connectedness. Then the next most-represented class is added where it dominates at the remaining unlabeled pixels. This continues until there is insuﬀicient evidence to add more (figure 10.20).\n",

Typical convolutional networks consist of convolutional layers interspersed with layers that downsample by a factor of two. As the network progresses, the spatial dimensions usually decrease by factors of two, and the number of channels increases by factors of two. At the end of the network, there are typically one or more fully connected layers that integrate information from across the entire input and create the desired output. If the output is an image, a mirrored “decoder” upsamples back to the original size. The translational equivariance of convolutional layers imposes a useful inductive bias that increases performance for image-based tasks relative to fully connected networks. We described image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation networks. Image classification performance was shown to improve as the network became deeper. However, subsequent experiments showed that increasing the network depth indefinitely doesn’t continue to help; after a certain depth, the system becomes diﬀicult to train. This is the motivation for residual connections, which are the topic of the next chapter. Notes Dumoulin & Visin (2016) present an overview of the mathematics of convolutions that expands on the brief treatment in this chapter. Convolutional networks: Early convolutional networks were developed by Fukushima & Miyake (1982), LeCun et al. (1989a), and LeCun et al. (1989b). Initial applications included This work is subject to a Creative Commons CC-BY-NC-ND license. (C) MIT Press. Notes 181 handwriting recognition (LeCun et al., 1989a; Martin, 1993), face recognition (Lawrence et al., 1997), phoneme recognition (Waibel et al., 1989), spoken word recognition (Bottou et al., 1990), and signature verification (Bromley et al., 1993). However, convolutional networks were popu- larized by LeCun et al. (1998), who built a system called LeNet for classifying 28×28 grayscale images of handwritten digits. This is immediately recognizable as a precursor of modern net- works; it uses a series of convolutional layers, followed by fully connected layers, sigmoid activa- tions rather than ReLUs, and average pooling rather than max pooling. AlexNet (Krizhevsky et al., 2012) is widely considered the starting point for modern deep convolutional networks. ImageNet Challenge: Deng et al. (2009) collated the ImageNet database and the associated classification challenge drove progress in deep learning for several years after AlexNet. Notable subsequent winners of this challenge include the network-in-network architecture (Lin et al., 2014), which alternated convolutions with fully connected layers that operated independently on all of the channels at each position (i.e., 1×1 convolutions). Zeiler & Fergus (2014) and Simonyan & Zisserman (2014) trained larger and deeper architectures that were fundamentally similar to AlexNet. Szegedy et al. (2017) developed an architecture called GoogLeNet, which introduced inception blocks. These use several parallel paths with different filter sizes, which are then recombined. This effectively allowed the system to learn the filter size. The trend was for performance to improve with increasing depth. However, it ultimately became diﬀicult to train deeper networks without modifications; these include residual connections and normalization layers, both of which are described in the next chapter. Progress in the ImageNet challenges is summarized in Russakovsky et al. (2015). A more general survey of image classification using convolutional networks can be found in Rawat & Wang (2017). The improvement of image classification networks over time is visualized in figure 10.21. Types of convolutional layers: Atrous or dilated convolutions were introduced by Chen et al. (2018c) and Yu & Koltun (2015). Transposed convolutions were introduced by Long et al. (2015). Odena et al. (2016) pointed out that they can lead to checkerboard artifacts and should be used with caution. Lin et al. (2014) is an early example of convolution with 1×1 filters. Many variants of the standard convolutional layer aim to reduce the number of parameters. These include depthwise or channel-separate convolution (Howard et al., 2017; Tran et al., 2018), in which a different filter convolves each channel separately to create a new set of channels. For a kernel size of K × K with C input channels and C output channels, this requires K × K × C parameters rather than the K × K × C × C parameters in a regular convolutional layer. A related approach is grouped convolutions (Xie et al., 2017), where each convolution kernel is only applied to a subset of the channels with a commensurate reduction in the parameters. In fact, grouped convolutions were used in AlexNet for computational reasons; the whole network could not run on a single GPU, so some channels were processed on one GPU and some on another, with limited interaction points. Separable convolutions treat each kernel as an outer product of 1D vectors; they use C + K + K parameters for each of the C channels. Partial convolutions (Liu et al., 2018a) are used when inpainting missing pixels and account for the partial masking of the input. Gated convolutions learn the mask from the previous layer (Yu et al., 2019; Chang et al., 2019b). Hu et al. (2018b) propose squeeze-and-excitation networks which re-weight the channels using information pooled across all spatial positions. Downsampling and upsampling: Average pooling dates back to at least LeCun et al. (1989a) and max pooling to Zhou & Chellappa (1988). Scherer et al. (2010) compared these methods and concluded that max pooling was superior. The max unpooling method was introduced by Zeiler et al. (2011) and Zeiler & Fergus (2014). Max pooling can be thought of as applying Draft: please send errata to udlbookmail@gmail.com. 182 10 Convolutional networks Figure 10.21 ImageNet performance.

This led to applying other Lk norms Appendix B.3.2 Vector norms (Springenberg et al., 2015; Sainath et al., 2013), although these require more computation and are not widely used. Zhang (2019) introduced max-blur-pooling, in which a low-pass filter is applied before downsampling to prevent aliasing, and showed that this improves generalization over translation of the inputs and protects against adversarial attacks (see section 20.4.6). Shi et al. (2016) introduced PixelShuffle, which used convolutional filters with a stride of 1/s to scale up 1D signals by a factor of s. Only the weights that lie exactly on positions are used to create the outputs, and the ones that fall between positions are discarded. This can be implemented by multiplying the number of channels in the kernel by a factor of s, where the sth output position is computed from just the sth subset of channels. This can be trivially extended to 2D convolution, which requires s2 channels. Convolution in 1D and 3D: Convolutional networks are usually applied to images but have also been applied to 1D data in applications that include speech recognition (Abdel-Hamid et al., 2012), sentence classification (Zhang et al., 2015; Conneau et al., 2017), electrocardiogram classification (Kiranyaz et al., 2015), and bearing fault diagnosis (Eren et al., 2019). A survey of 1D convolutional networks can be found in Kiranyaz et al. (2021). Convolutional networks have also been applied to 3D data, including video (Ji et al., 2012; Saha et al., 2016; Tran et al., 2015) and volumetric measurements (Wu et al., 2015b; Maturana & Scherer, 2015). Invariance and equivariance: Part of the motivation for convolutional layers is that they are approximately equivariant with respect to translation, and part of the motivation for max This work is subject to a Creative Commons CC-BY-NC-ND license. (C) MIT Press. Notes 183 pooling is to induce invariance to small translations. Zhang (2019) considers the degree to which convolutional networks really have these properties and proposes the max-blur-pooling modification that demonstrably improves them. There is considerable interest in making net- works equivariant or invariant to other types of transformations, such as reflections, rotations, and scaling. Sifre & Mallat (2013) constructed a system based on wavelets that induced both translational and rotational invariance in image patches and applied this to texture classifica- tion. Kanazawa et al. (2014) developed locally scale-invariant convolutional neural networks. Cohen & Welling (2016) exploited group theory to construct group CNNs, which are equivariant to larger families of transformations, including reflections and rotations. Esteves et al. (2018) introduced polar transformer networks, which are invariant to translations and equivariant to rotation and scale. Worrall et al. (2017) developed harmonic networks, the first example of a group CNN that was equivariant to continuous rotations. Initialization and regularization: Convolutional networks are typically initialized using Xavier initialization (Glorot & Bengio, 2010) or He initialization (He et al., 2015), as described in section 7.5. However, the ConvolutionOrthogonal initializer (Xiao et al., 2018a) is specialized Problem 10.19 for convolutional networks (Xiao et al., 2018a). Networks of up to 10,000 layers can be trained using this initialization without the need for residual connections. Dropout is effective for fully connected networks but less so for convolutional layers (Park & Kwak, 2016). This may be because neighboring image pixels are highly correlated, so if a hidden unit drops out, the same information is passed on via adjacent positions. This is the motivation for spatial dropout and cutout. In spatial dropout (Tompson et al., 2015), entire feature maps are discarded instead of individual pixels. This circumvents the problem of neighboring pixels carrying the same information. Similarly, DeVries & Taylor (2017b) propose cutout, in which a square patch of each input image is masked at training time. Wu & Gu (2015) modified max pooling for dropout layers using a method that involves sampling from a probability distribution over the constituent elements rather than always taking the maximum. Adaptive Kernels: The inception block (Szegedy et al., 2017) applies convolutional filters of different sizes in parallel and, as such, provides a crude mechanism by which the network can learn the appropriate filter size. Other work has investigated learning the scale of convolutions as part of the training process (e.g., Pintea et al., 2021; Romero et al., 2021) or the stride of downsampling layers (Riad et al., 2022). In some systems, the kernel size is changed adaptively based on the data. This is sometimes in the context of guided convolution, where one input is used to help guide the computation from another input. For example, an RGB image might be used to help upsample a low-resolution depth map. Jia et al. (2016) directly predicted the filter weights themselves using a different network branch. Xiong et al. (2020b) change the kernel size adaptively. Su et al. (2019a) moderate weights of fixed kernels by a function learned from another modality. Dai et al. (2017) learn offsets of weights so that they do not have to be applied in a regular grid. Object detection and semantic segmentation: Object detection methods can be divided into proposal-based and proposal-free schemes. In the former case, processing occurs in two stages. A convolutional network ingests the whole image and proposes regions that might contain objects. These proposal regions are then resized, and a second network analyzes them to establish whether there is an object there and what it is. An early example of this approach was R-CNN (Girshick et al., 2014). This was subsequently extended to allow end-to-end training (Girshick, 2015) and to reduce the cost of the region proposals (Ren et al., 2015). Subsequent work on feature pyramid networks improved both performance and speed by combining features Draft: please send errata to udlbookmail@gmail.com. 184 10 Convolutional networks across multiple scales Lin et al. (2017b). In contrast, proposal-free schemes perform all the processing in a single pass. YOLO Redmon et al. (2016), which was described in section 10.5.2, is the most celebrated example of a proposal-free scheme. The most recent iteration of this framework at the time of writing is YOLOv7 (Wang et al., 2022a). A recent review of object detection can be found in Zou et al. (2023). The semantic segmentation network described in section 10.5.3 was developed by Noh et al. (2015). Many subsequent approaches have been variations of U-Net (Ronneberger et al., 2015), which is described in section 11.5.3. Recent surveys of semantic segmentation can be found in Minaee et al. (2021) and Ulku & Akagündüz (2022). Visualizing Convolutional Networks: The dramatic success of convolutional networks led to a series of efforts to visualize the information they extract from the image (see Qin et al., 2018, for a review). Erhan et al. (2009) visualized the optimal stimulus that activated a hidden unit by starting with an image containing noise and then optimizing the input to make the hidden unit most active using gradient ascent. Zeiler & Fergus (2014) trained a network to reconstruct the input and then set all the hidden units to zero except the one they were interested in; the reconstruction then provides information about what drives the hidden unit. Mahendran & Vedaldi (2015) visualized an entire layer of a network. Their network inversion technique aimed to find an image that resulted in the activations at that layer but also incorporates prior knowledge that encourages this image to have similar statistics to natural images. Finally, Bau et al. (2017) introduced network dissection. Here, a series of images with known pixel labels capturing color, texture, and object type are passed through the network, and the correlation of a hidden unit with each property is measured. This method has the advantage that it only uses the forward pass of the network and does not require optimization. These methods did provide some partial insight into how the network processes images. For example, Bau et al. (2017) showed that earlier layers correlate more with texture and color and later layers with the object type. However, it is fair to say that fully understanding the processing of networks containing millions of parameters is currently not possible.

Chapter 11 Residual networks The previous chapter described how image classification performance improved as the depth of convolutional networks was extended from eight layers (AlexNet) to eighteen layers (VGG). This led to experimentation with even deeper networks. However, per- formance decreased again when many more layers were added. This chapter introduces residual blocks. Here, each network layer computes an addi- tive change to the current representation instead of transforming it directly. This allows deeper networks to be trained but causes an exponential increase in the activation mag- nitudes at initialization. Residual blocks employ batch normalization to compensate for this, which re-centers and rescales the activations at each layer. Residual blocks with batch normalization allow much deeper networks to be trained, and these networks improve performance across a variety of tasks. Architectures that combine residual blocks to tackle image classification, medical image segmentation, and human pose estimation are described.\n",

However, image classification performance decreases again as further layers are added (figure 11.2). This is surprising since models generally perform better as more capacity is added (figure 8.10). Indeed, the decrease is present for both the training set and the test set, which implies that the problem is training deeper networks rather than the inability of deeper networks to generalize. This phenomenon is not completely understood. One conjecture is that at initial- ization, the loss gradients change unpredictably when we modify parameters in early network layers. With appropriate initialization of the weights (see section 7.5), the gra- dient of the loss with respect to these parameters will be reasonable (i.e., no exploding or vanishing gradients). However, the derivative assumes an infinitesimal change in the parameter, whereas optimization algorithms use a finite step size. Any reasonable choice Notebook 11.1 Shattered gradients of step size may move to a place with a completely different and unrelated gradient; the loss surface looks like an enormous range of tiny mountains rather than a single smooth structure that is easy to descend. Consequently, the algorithm doesn’t make progress in the way that it does when the loss function gradient changes more slowly. This conjecture is supported by empirical observations of gradients in networks with a single input and output. For a shallow network, the gradient of the output with re- spect to the input changes slowly as we change the input (figure 11.3a). However, for a Appendix B.2.1 Autocorrelation function deep network, a tiny change in the input results in a completely different gradient (fig- ure 11.3b). This is captured by the autocorrelation function of the gradient (figure 11.3c). Nearby gradients are correlated for shallow networks, but this correlation quickly drops to zero for deep networks. This is termed the shattered gradients phenomenon.

This shattered gradients phenomenon may explain why it is hard to train deep networks. Gradient descent algorithms rely on the loss surface being relatively smooth, so the gradients should be related before and after each update step. Adapted from Balduzzi et al. (2017).

The derivative of the output y with respect to the first layer f1 of the network in equation 11.1 is: ∂y ∂f1 = ∂f4 ∂f3 ∂f3 ∂f2 ∂f2 ∂f1 . (11.3) When we change the parameters that determine f1, all of the derivatives in this sequence can change since layers f2, f3, and f4 are themselves computed from f1. Consequently, the updated gradient at each training example may be completely different, and the loss function becomes badly behaved.1\n",

      "│   │   │   └──  Until now, we have implied that the additive functions f[x] could be any valid network layer (e.g., fully connected or convolutional). This is technically true, but the order of operations in these functions is important. They must contain a nonlinear activation function like a ReLU, or the entire network will be linear. However, in a typical network layer (figure 11.5a), the ReLU function is at the end, so the output is non-negative. If we adopt this convention, then each residual block can only increase the input values. Hence, it is typical to change the order of operations so that the activation function is applied first, followed by the linear transformation (figure 11.5b). Sometimes there may be several layers of processing within the residual block (figure 11.5c), but these usually terminate with a linear transformation. Finally, we note that when we start these blocks with a ReLU operation, they will do nothing if the initial network input is negative since the ReLU will clip the entire signal to zero. Hence, it’s typical to start the network with a linear transformation rather than a residual block, as in figure 11.5b.

      "│   │   └── In section 7.5, we saw that initializing the network parameters is critical. Without careful initialization, the magnitudes of the intermediate values during the forward pass of backpropagation can increase or decrease exponentially. Similarly, the gradients during the backward pass can explode or vanish as we move backward through the network. Hence, we initialize the network parameters so that the expected variance of the activations (in the forward pass) and gradients (in the backward pass) remains the same between layers. He initialization (section 7.5) achieves this for ReLU activations by initializing the biases β to zero and choosing normally distributed weights Ωwith mean zero and variance 2/Dh where Dh is the number of hidden units in the previous layer. Now consider a residual network. We do not have to worry about the intermediate values or gradients vanishing with network depth since there exists a path whereby each layer directly contributes to the network output (equation 11.5 and figure 11.4b). However, even if we use He initialization within the residual block, the values in the forward pass increase exponentially as we move through the network. To see why, consider that we add the result of the processing in the residual block back to the input. Each branch has some (uncorrelated) variability. Hence, the overall variance Problem 11.4 increases when we recombine them. With ReLU activations and He initialization, the expected variance is unchanged by the processing in each block. Consequently, when we recombine with the input, the variance doubles (figure 11.6a), growing exponentially with the number of residual blocks. This limits the possible network depth before floating point precision is exceeded in the forward pass. A similar argument applies to the gradients in the backward pass of the backpropagation algorithm. Hence, residual networks still suffer from unstable forward propagation and exploding gradients even with He initialization. One approach that would stabilize the forward and backward passes would be to use He initialization and then multiply the combined output of each residual block by 1/ √ 2 to compensate for the doubling (figure 11.6b). However, it is more usual to use batch normalization.\n",

      "│   │       └──  Batch normalization makes the network invariant to rescaling the weights and biases that contribute to each activation; if these are doubled, then the activations also double, the estimated standard deviation sh doubles, and the normalization in equation 11.8 com- pensates for these changes. This happens separately for each hidden unit. Consequently, there will be a large family of weights and biases that all produce the same effect. Batch normalization also adds two parameters, γ and δ, at every hidden unit, which makes the model somewhat larger. Hence, it both creates redundancy in the weight parameters and adds extra parameters to compensate for that redundancy. This is obviously ineﬀicient, but batch normalization also provides several benefits. Stable forward propagation: If we initialize the offsets δ to zero and the scales γ to one, then each output activation will have unit variance. In a regular network, this ensures the variance is stable during forward propagation at initialization. In a residual network, the variance must still increase as we add a new source of variation to the input at each layer. However, it will increase linearly with each residual block; the kth layer adds one unit of variance to the existing variance of k (figure 11.6c). At initialization, this has the side-effect that later layers make a smaller change to the overall variation than earlier ones. The network is effectively less deep at the start of training since later layers are close to computing the identity. As training proceeds, the network can increase the scales γ in later layers and can control its own effective depth. Higher learning rates: Empirical studies and theory both show that batch normaliza- tion makes the loss surface and its gradient change more smoothly (i.e., reduces shat- tered gradients). This means we can use higher learning rates as the surface is more predictable. We saw in section 9.2 that higher learning rates improve test performance. Regularization: We also saw in chapter 9 that adding noise to the training process can improve generalization. Batch normalization injects noise because the normaliza- tion depends on the batch statistics. The activations for a given training example are normalized by an amount that depends on the other members of the batch and will be slightly different at each training iteration.

In ResNets, each residual block contains a batch normalization operation, a ReLU activation function, and a convolutional layer. This is followed by the same sequence again before being added Problem 11.7 back to the input (figure 11.7a). Trial and error have shown that this order of operations works well for image classification. For very deep networks, the number of parameters may become undesirably large. Bottleneck residual blocks make more eﬀicient use of parameters using three convolutions. The first has a 1×1 kernel and reduces the number of channels. The second is a regular 3×3 kernel, and the third is another 1×1 kernel to increase the number of channels back to the original amount (figure 11.7b). In this way, we can integrate information over a 3×3 pixel area using fewer parameters. Problem 11.8 The ResNet-200 model (figure 11.8) contains 200 layers and was used for image clas- sification on the ImageNet database (figure 10.15). The architecture resembles AlexNet and VGG but uses bottleneck residual blocks instead of vanilla convolutional layers. As with AlexNet and VGG, these are periodically interspersed with decreases in spatial resolution and simultaneous increases in the number of channels. Here, the resolution is decreased by downsampling using convolutions with stride two. The number of channels is increased either by appending zeros to the representation or by using an extra 1×1 convolution. At the start of the network is a 7×7 convolutional layer, followed by a downsampling operation. At the end, a fully connected layer maps the block to a vector of length 1000. This is passed through a softmax layer to generate class probabilities. The ResNet-200 model achieved a remarkable 4.8% error rate for the correct class being in the top five and 20.1% for identifying the correct class correctly. This compared favorably with AlexNet (16.4%, 38.1%) and VGG (6.8%, 23.7%) and was one of the first networks to exceed human performance (5.1% for being in the top five guesses). However, this model was conceived in 2016 and is far from state-of-the-art. At the time of writing, the best-performing model on this task has a 9.0% error for identifying the class correctly (see figure 10.21). This and all the other current top-performing models for image classification are now based on transformers (see chapter 12).\n",

This architecture uses residual connections to concatenate the outputs of earlier layers to later ones. Here, the three-channel input image is processed to form a 32-channel representation. The input image is concatenated to this to give a total of 35 channels. This combined representation is processed to create another 32-channel representation, and both earlier representations are concatenated to this to create a total of 67 channels and so on. (in terms of channels for a convolutional network), but an optional subsequent linear transformation can map back to the original size (a 1×1 convolution for a convolutional network). This allows the model to add the representations together, take a weighted sum, or combine them in a more complex way. The DenseNet architecture uses concatenation so that the input to a layer comprises the concatenated outputs from all previous layers (figure 11.9). These are processed to create a new representation that is itself concatenated with the previous representation and passed to the next layer. This concatenation means there is a direct contribution from earlier layers to the output, so the loss surface behaves reasonably. In practice, this can only be sustained for a few layers because the number of channels (and hence the number of parameters required to process them) becomes increasingly large. This problem can be alleviated by applying a 1×1 convolution to reduce the number of channels before the next 3×3 convolution is applied. In a convolutional network, the input is periodically downsampled. Concatenation across the downsampling makes no sense since the representations have different sizes. Consequently, the chain of concatenation is broken at this point, and a smaller representation starts a new chain. In addition, another bottleneck 1×1 convolution can be applied when the downsampling occurs to control the representation size further. This network performs competitively with ResNet models on image classification (see figure 10.21); indeed, it can perform better for a comparable parameter count. This is presumably because it can reuse processing from earlier layers more flexibly.\n",

The U-Net has an encoder-decoder structure, in which the representation is downsampled (orange blocks) and then re-upsampled (blue blocks). The encoder uses regular convolutions, and the de- coder uses transposed convolutions. Residual connections append the last repre- sentation at each scale in the encoder to the first representation at the same scale in the decoder (orange arrows). The original U-Net used “valid” convolutions, so the size decreased slightly with each layer, even without downsampling. Hence, the representations from the encoder were cropped (dashed squares) before ap- pending to the decoder. Adapted from Ronneberger et al. (2015). upsamples it back to the size of the original image. The final output is a probability over possible object classes at each pixel. One drawback of this architecture is that the low-resolution representation in the middle of the network must “remember” the high-resolution details to make the final result accurate. This is unnecessary if residual connections transfer the representations from the encoder to their partner in the decoder. The U-Net (figure 11.10) is an encoder-decoder architecture where the earlier repre- sentations are concatenated to the later ones. The original implementation used “valid” convolutions, so the spatial size decreases by two pixels each time a 3×3 convolutional layer is applied. This means that the upsampled version is smaller than its counterpart in the encoder, which must be cropped before concatenation. Subsequent implementa- tions have used zero padding, where this cropping is unnecessary. Note that the U-Net is completely convolutional, so after training, it can be run on an image of any size. Problem 11.9 The U-Net was intended for segmenting medical images (figure 11.11) but has found many other uses in computer graphics and vision. Hourglass networks are similar but apply further convolutional layers in the skip connections and add the result back to the decoder rather than concatenating it. A series of these models form a stacked hourglass network that alternates between considering the image at local and global levels. Such networks are used for pose estimation (figure 11.12).

The improvement in image classification performance was initially attributed to the additional network depth, but two pieces of evidence contradict this viewpoint. First, shallower, wider residual networks sometimes outperform deeper, narrower ones with a comparable parameter count. In other words, better performance can sometimes be achieved with a network with fewer layers but more channels per layer. Second, there is evidence that the gradients during training do not propagate effectively through very long paths in the unraveled network (figure 11.4b). In effect, a very deep network may act more like a combination of shallower networks. The current view is that residual connections add some value of their own, as well as allowing deeper networks to be trained. This perspective is supported by the fact that the loss surfaces of residual networks around a minimum tend to be smoother and more predictable than those for the same network when the skip connections are removed (figure 11.13).

Now each layer contributes directly to the output as well as indirectly, so propagating gradients through many layers is not mandatory, and the loss surface is smoother. Residual networks don’t suffer from vanishing gradients but introduce an exponential increase in the variance of the activations during forward propagation and corresponding problems with exploding gradients. This is usually handled by adding batch normaliza- tion, which compensates for the empirical mean and variance of the batch and then shifts and rescales using learned parameters. If these parameters are initialized judi- ciously, very deep networks can be trained. There is evidence that both residual links and batch normalization make the loss surface smoother, which permits larger learning rates. Moreover, the variability in the batch statistics adds a source of regularization. Residual blocks have been incorporated into convolutional networks. They allow deeper networks to be trained with commensurate increases in image classification per- formance. Variations of residual networks include the DenseNet architecture, which concatenates outputs of all prior layers to feed into the current layer, and U-Nets, which incorporate residual connections into encoder-decoder models. Notes Residual connections: Residual connections were introduced by He et al. (2016a), who built a network with 152 layers, which was eight times larger than VGG (figure 10.17), and achieved state-of-the-art performance on the ImageNet classification task. Each residual block consisted Draft: please send errata to udlbookmail@gmail.com. 202 11 Residual networks of a convolutional layer followed by batch normalization, a ReLU activation, a second convolu- tional layer, and second batch normalization. A second ReLU function was applied after this block was added back to the main representation. This architecture was termed ResNet v1. He et al. (2016b) investigated different variations of residual architectures, in which either (i) processing could also be applied along the skip connection or (ii) after the two branches had recombined. They concluded neither was necessary, leading to the architecture in figure 11.7, which is sometimes termed a pre-activation residual block and is the backbone of ResNet v2. They trained a network with 200 layers that improved further on the ImageNet classification task (see figure 11.8). Since this time, new methods for regularization, optimization, and data augmentation have been developed, and Wightman et al. (2021) exploit these to present a more modern training pipeline for the ResNet architecture. Why residual connections help: Residual networks certainly allow deeper networks to be trained. Presumably, this is related to reducing shattered gradients (Balduzzi et al., 2017) at the start of training and the smoother loss surface near the minima as depicted in figure 11.13 (Li et al., 2018b). Residual connections alone (i.e., without batch normalization) increase the trainable depth of a network by roughly a factor of two (Sankararaman et al., 2020). With batch normalization, very deep networks can be trained, but it is unclear that depth is critical for performance. Zagoruyko & Komodakis (2016) showed that wide residual networks with only 16 layers outperformed all residual networks of the time for image classification. Orhan & Pitkow (2017) propose a different explanation for why residual connections improve learning in terms of eliminating singularities (places on the loss surface where the Hessian is degenerate). Related architectures: Residual connections are a special case of highway networks (Srivas- tava et al., 2015) which also split the computation into two branches and additively recombine. Highway networks use a gating function that weights the inputs to the two branches in a way that depends on the data itself, whereas residual networks send the data down both branches in a straightforward manner. Xie et al. (2017) introduced the ResNeXt architecture, which places a residual connection around multiple parallel convolutional branches. Residual networks as ensembles: Veit et al. (2016) characterized residual networks as en- sembles of shorter networks and depicted the “unraveled network” interpretation (figure 11.4b). They provide evidence that this interpretation is valid by showing that deleting layers in a trained network (and hence a subset of paths) only has a modest effect on performance. Con- versely, removing a layer in a purely sequential network like VGG is catastrophic. They also looked at the gradient magnitudes along paths of different lengths and showed that the gradient vanishes in longer paths. In a residual network consisting of 54 blocks, almost all of the gradient updates during training were from paths of length 5 to 17 blocks long, even though these only constitute 0.45% of the total paths. It seems that adding more blocks effectively adds more parallel shorter paths rather than creating a network that is truly deeper. Regularization for residual networks: L2 regularization of the weights has a fundamentally different effect in vanilla networks and residual networks without BatchNorm. In the former, it encourages the output of the layer to be a constant function determined by the biases. In the latter, it encourages the residual block to compute the identity plus a constant determined by the biases. Several regularization methods have been developed that are targeted specifically at residual architectures. ResDrop (Yamada et al., 2016), stochastic depth (Huang et al., 2016), and RandomDrop (Yamada et al., 2019) all regularize residual networks by randomly dropping residual blocks during the training process. In the latter case, the propensity for dropping a block is determined by a Bernoulli variable, whose parameter is linearly decreased during training. At test time, the residual blocks are added back in with their expected probability. These methods are effectively versions of dropout, in which all the hidden units in a block are simultaneously This work is subject to a Creative Commons CC-BY-NC-ND license. (C) MIT Press. Notes 203 dropped in concert. In the multiple paths view of residual networks (figure 11.4b), they simply remove some of the paths at each training step. Wu et al. (2018b) developed BlockDrop, which analyzes an existing network and decides which residual blocks to use at runtime with the goal of improving the eﬀiciency of inference. Other regularization methods have been developed for networks with multiple paths inside the residual block. Shake-shake (Gastaldi, 2017a,b) randomly re-weights the paths during the forward and backward passes. In the forward pass, this can be viewed as synthesizing random data, and in the backward pass, as injecting another form of noise into the training method. ShakeDrop (Yamada et al., 2019) draws a Bernoulli variable that decides whether each block will be subject to Shake-Shake or behave like a standard residual unit on this training step. Batch normalization: Batch normalization was introduced by Ioffe & Szegedy (2015) outside of the context of residual networks. They showed empirically that it allowed higher learning rates, increased convergence speed, and made sigmoid activation functions more practical (since the distribution of outputs is controlled, so examples are less likely to fall in the saturated extremes of the sigmoid). Balduzzi et al. (2017) investigated the activation of hidden units in later layers of deep networks with ReLU functions at initialization. They showed that many such hidden units were always active or always inactive regardless of the input but that BatchNorm reduced this tendency. Although batch normalization helps stabilize the forward propagation of signals through a network, Yang et al. (2019) showed that it causes gradient explosion in ReLU networks without skip connections, with each layer increasing the magnitude of the gradients by p π/(π −1) ≈ 1.21. This argument is summarized by Luther (2020). Since a residual network can be seen as a combination of paths of different lengths (figure 11.4), this effect must also be present in residual networks. Presumably, however, the benefit of removing the 2K increases in magnitude in the forward pass of a network with K layers outweighs the harm done by increasing the gradients by 1.21K in the backward pass, so overall BatchNorm makes training more stable. Variations of batch normalization: Several variants of BatchNorm have been proposed (figure 11.14). BatchNorm normalizes each channel separately based on statistics gathered across the batch. Ghost batch normalization or GhostNorm (Hoffer et al., 2017) uses only part of the batch to compute the normalization statistics, which makes them noisier and increases the amount of regularization when the batch size is very large (figure 11.14b). When the batch size is very small or the fluctuations within a batch are very large (as is often the case in natural language processing), the statistics in BatchNorm may become unreliable. Ioffe (2017) proposed batch renormalization, which keeps a running average of the batch statistics and modifies the normalization of any batch to ensure that it is more representative. Another problem is that batch normalization is unsuitable for use in recurrent neural networks (networks for processing sequences, in which the previous output is fed back as an additional input as we move through the sequence (see figure 12.19). Here, the statistics must be stored at each step in the sequence, and it’s unclear what to do if a test sequence is longer than the training sequences. A third problem is that batch normalization needs access to the whole batch. However, this may not be easily available when training is distributed across several machines. Layer normalization or LayerNorm (Ba et al., 2016) avoids using batch statistics by normalizing each data example separately, using statistics gathered across the channels and spatial position (figure 11.14c). However, there is still a separate learned scale γ and offset δ per channel. Group normalization or GroupNorm (Wu & He, 2018) is similar to LayerNorm but divides the channels into groups and computes the statistics for each group separately across the within- group channels and the spatial positions (figure 11.14d). Again, there are still separate scale and offset parameters per channel. Instance normalization or InstanceNorm (Ulyanov et al., 2016) takes this to the extreme where the number of groups is the same as the number of channels, so each channel is normalized separately (figure 11.14e), using statistics gathered across spatial Draft: please send errata to udlbookmail@gmail.com. 204 11 Residual networks Figure 11.14 Normalization schemes. BatchNorm modifies each channel sepa- rately but adjusts each batch member in the same way based on statistics gath- ered across the batch and spatial position. Ghost BatchNorm computes these statistics from only part of the batch to make them more variable. LayerNorm computes statistics for each batch member separately, based on statistics gath- ered across the channels and spatial position. It retains a separate learned scaling factor for each channel. GroupNorm normalizes within each group of channels and also retains a separate scale and offset parameter for each channel. Instan- ceNorm normalizes within each channel separately, computing the statistics only across spatial position. Adapted from Wu & He (2018). position alone. Salimans & Kingma (2016) investigated normalizing the network weights rather than the activations, but this has been less empirically successful. Teye et al. (2018) introduced Monte Carlo batch normalization, which can provide meaningful estimates of uncertainty in the predictions of neural networks. A recent comparison of the properties of different normalization schemes can be found in Lubana et al. (2021). Why BatchNorm helps: BatchNorm helps control the initial gradients in a residual network (figure 11.6c). However, the mechanism by which BatchNorm improves performance is not well understood. The stated goal of Ioffe & Szegedy (2015) was to reduce problems caused by internal covariate shift, which is the change in the distribution of inputs to a layer caused by updating preceding layers during the backpropagation update. However, Santurkar et al. (2018) provided evidence against this view by artificially inducing covariate shift and showing that networks with and without BatchNorm performed equally well. Motivated by this, they searched for another explanation for why BatchNorm should improve performance. They showed empirically for the VGG network that adding batch normalization decreases the variation in both the loss and its gradient as we move in the gradient direction. In other words, the loss surface is both smoother and changes more slowly, which is why larger learning rates are possible. They also provide theoretical proofs for both these phenomena and show that for any parameter initialization, the distance to the nearest optimum is less for networks with batch normalization. Bjorck et al. (2018) also argue that BatchNorm improves the properties of the loss landscape and allows larger learning rates. Other explanations of why BatchNorm improves performance include decreasing the importance of tuning the learning rate (Ioffe & Szegedy, 2015; Arora et al., 2018). Indeed Li & Arora (2019) show that using an exponentially increasing learning rate schedule is possible with batch normalization. Ultimately, this is because batch normalization makes the network invariant to the scales of the weight matrices (see Huszár, 2019, for an intuitive visualization). Hoffer et al. (2017) identified that BatchNorm has a regularizing effect due to statistical fluc- This work is subject to a Creative Commons CC-BY-NC-ND license. (C) MIT Press. Notes 205 tuations from the random composition of the batch. They proposed using a ghost batch size, in which the mean and standard deviation statistics are computed from a subset of the batch. Large batches can now be used without losing the regularizing effect of the extra noise in smaller batch sizes. Luo et al. (2018) investigate the regularization effects of batch normalization. Alternatives to batch normalization: Although BatchNorm is widely used, it is not strictly necessary to train deep residual nets; there are other ways of making the loss surface tractable. Balduzzi et al. (2017) proposed the rescaling by p 1/2 in figure 11.6b; they argued that it prevents gradient explosion but does not resolve the problem of shattered gradients. Other work has investigated rescaling the function’s output in the residual block before adding it back to the input. For example, De & Smith (2020) introduce SkipInit, in which a learnable scalar multiplier is placed at the end of each residual branch. This helps if this multiplier is initialized to less than p 1/K, where K is the number of residual blocks. In practice, they suggest initializing this to zero. Similarly, Hayou et al. (2021) introduce Stable ResNet, which rescales the output of the function in the kth residual block (before addition to the main branch) by a constant λk. They prove that in the limit of infinite width, the expected gradient norm of the weights in the first layer is lower bounded by the sum of squares of the scalings λk. They investigate setting these to a constant p 1/K, where K is the number of residual blocks and show that it is possible to train networks with up to 1000 blocks. Zhang et al. (2019a) introduce FixUp, in which every layer is initialized using He normalization, but the last linear/convolutional layer of every residual block is set to zero. Now the initial forward pass is stable (since each residual block contributes nothing), and the gradients do not explode in the backward pass (for the same reason). They also rescale the branches so that the magnitude of the total expected change in the parameters is constant regardless of the number of residual blocks. These methods allow training of deep residual networks but don’t usually achieve the same test performance as when using BatchNorm. This is probably because they do not benefit from the regularization induced by the noisy batch statistics. De & Smith (2020) modify their method to induce regularization via dropout, which helps close this gap. DenseNet and U-Net: DenseNet was first introduced by Huang et al. (2017b), U-Net was developed by Ronneberger et al. (2015), and stacked hourglass networks by Newell et al. (2016). Of these architectures, U-Net has been the most extensively adapted. Çiçek et al. (2016) in- troduced 3D U-Net, and Milletari et al. (2016) introduced V-Net, both of which extend U-Net to process 3D data. Zhou et al. (2018) combine the ideas of DenseNet and U-Net in an archi- tecture that downsamples and re-upsamples the image but also repeatedly uses intermediate representations. U-Nets are commonly used in medical image segmentation (see Siddique et al., 2021, for a review). However, they have been applied to other areas, including depth estimation (Garg et al., 2016), semantic segmentation (Iglovikov & Shvets, 2018), inpainting (Zeng et al., 2019), pansharpening (Yao et al., 2018), and image-to-image translation (Isola et al., 2017).

Chapter 12 Transformers Chapter 10 introduced convolutional networks, which are specialized for processing data that lie on a regular grid. They are particularly suited to processing images, which have a very large number of input variables, precluding the use of fully connected networks. Each layer of a convolutional network employs parameter sharing so that local image patches are processed similarly at every position in the image. This chapter introduces transformers. These were initially targeted at natural lan- guage processing (NLP) problems, where the network input is a series of high-dimensional embeddings representing words or word fragments. Language datasets share some of the characteristics of image data. The number of input variables can be very large, and the statistics are similar at every position; it’s not sensible to re-learn the meaning of the word dog at every possible position in a body of text. However, language datasets have the complication that text sequences vary in length, and unlike images, there is no easy way to resize them.\n",

These observations suggest that the network should share parameters across words at different input positions, similarly to how convolutional networks share parameters across different image positions. Third, language is ambiguous; it is unclear from the syntax alone that the pronoun it refers to the restaurant and not to the ham sandwich. To understand the text, the word it should somehow be connected to the word restaurant. In the parlance of transformers, the former word should pay attention to the latter. This implies that there must be connections between the words and that the strength of these connections will depend on the words themselves. Moreover, these connections need to extend across large text spans. For example, the word their in the last sentence also refers to the restaurant.\n",

The system is trained for a million steps, corresponding to roughly 50 epochs of the 3.3-billion word corpus. Predicting missing words forces the transformer network to understand some syntax.

It also allows the model to learn superficial common sense about the world. For example, after training, the model will assign a higher probability to the missing word train in the sentence The <mask> pulled into the station than it would to the word peanut.

For text classification tasks like sentiment analysis (in which the passage is labeled as having a positive or negative emotional tone), the vector associated with the <cls> token is mapped to a single number and passed through a logistic sigmoid (figure 12.11a).

To this end, each input embedding xn is mapped to an E × 1 vector where the E entries correspond to the E entity types. This is passed through a softmax function to create probabilities for each class, which contribute to a multiclass cross-entropy loss (figure 12.11b). Text span prediction: In the SQuAD 1.1 question answering task, the question and a passage from Wikipedia containing the answer are concatenated and tokenized. BERT is then used to predict the text span in the passage that contains the answer. Each token maps to two numbers indicating how likely it is that the text span begins and ends at this location. The resulting two sets of numbers are put through two softmax functions. The likelihood of any text span being the answer can be derived by combining the probability of starting and ending at the appropriate places. 12.7 Decoder model example: GPT3 This section presents a high-level description of GPT3, an example of a decoder model.

One approach is to prune the self-attention in- teractions or, equivalently, to sparsify the interaction matrix (figures 12.15c-h). For example, this can be restricted to a convolutional structure so that each token only in- teracts with a few neighboring tokens. Across multiple layers, tokens still interact at larger distances as the receptive field expands. As for convolution in images, the kernel can vary in size and dilation rate. A pure convolutional approach requires many layers to integrate information over large distances. One way to speed up this process is to allow select tokens (perhaps at the start of every sentence) to attend to all other tokens (encoder model) or all previous tokens (decoder model). A similar idea is to have a small number of global tokens that connect to all the other tokens and themselves.

First, there are many more pixels in an image than words in a sentence, so the quadratic complexity of self-attention poses a practical bottleneck. Second, convolutional nets have a good inductive bias because each layer is equivariant to spatial translation, and they take into account the 2D structure of the image. However, this must be learned in a transformer network. Regardless of these apparent disadvantages, transformer networks for images have now eclipsed the performance of convolutional networks for image classification and other tasks.

This is in contrast to images, where permuting the pixels creates a different image, and to text, where permuting the words creates a different sentence. The operation of exchanging node indices can be expressed mathematically by a permutation matrix, P.

Super- vised graph problems usually fall into one of three categories (figure 13.6). Graph-level tasks: The network assigns a label or estimates one or more values from the entire graph, exploiting both the structure and node embeddings. For example, we might want to predict the temperature at which a molecule becomes liquid (a regression task) or whether a molecule is poisonous to human beings or not (a classification task). For graph-level tasks, the output node embeddings are combined (e.g., by averaging), and the resulting vector is mapped via a linear transformation or neural network to a fixed-size vector. For regression, the mismatch between the result and the ground truth values is computed using the least squares loss. For binary classification, the output is passed through a sigmoid function, and the mismatch is calculated using the binary cross-entropy loss. Here, the probability that the graph belongs to class one might be given by: Pr(y = 1|X, A) = sig [βK + ωKHK1/N] , (13.2) where the scalar βK and 1 × D vector ωK are learned parameters. Post-multiplying the output embedding matrix HK by the column vector 1 that contains ones has the effect of summing together all the embeddings and subsequently dividing by the number of nodes N computes the average. This is known as mean pooling (see figure 10.11). This work is subject to a Creative Commons CC-BY-NC-ND license.

In each case, the input is a graph repre- sented by its adjacency matrix and node embeddings. The graph neural network processes the node embeddings by passing them through a series of layers. The node embeddings at the last layer contain information about both the node and its context in the graph. a) Graph classification. The node embeddings are com- bined (e.g., by averaging) and then mapped to a fixed-size vector that is passed through a softmax function to produce class probabilities. b) Node classification. Each node embedding is used individually as the basis for classification (cyan and orange colors represent assigned node classes). c) Edge prediction. Node embeddings adjacent to the edge are combined (e.g., by taking the dot product) to compute a single number that is mapped via a sigmoid function to produce a probability that a missing edge should be present.

For example, given a graph constructed from a 3D point cloud similar to figure 13.2d, the goal might be to classify the nodes according to whether they belong to the wings or fuselage. Loss functions are defined in the same way as for graph-level tasks, except that now this is done independently at each node n: Pr(y(n) = 1|X, A) = sig h βK + ωKh(n) K i . (13.3) Edge prediction tasks: The network predicts whether or not there should be an edge between nodes n and m. For example, in the social network setting, the network might predict whether two people know and like each other and suggest that they connect if that is the case. This is a binary classification task where the two node embeddings must be mapped to a single number representing the probability that the edge is present. One possibility is to take the dot product of the node embeddings and pass the result through a sigmoid function to create the probability: Pr(y(mn) = 1|X, A) = sig h h(m)T h(n)i . (13.4)\n",

It is hence imperative that any model respects this property. It follows that each layer must be equivariant (see section 10.1) with respect to permutations of the node indices. In other words, if we permute the node indices, the node embeddings at each stage will be permuted in the same way. In mathematical terms, if P is a permutation matrix, then we must have: Hk+1P = F[HkP, PT AP, ϕk]. (13.6) For node classification and edge prediction tasks, the output should also be equiv- ariant with respect to permutations of the node indices. However, for graph-level tasks, the final layer aggregates information from across the graph, so the output is invariant Problem 13.6 to the node order. In fact, the output layer from equation 13.2 achieves this because: y = sig [βK + ωKHK1/N] = sig [βK + ωKHKP1/N] , (13.7) for any permutation matrix P (see problem 13.6). This mirrors the case for images, where segmentation should be equivariant to geo- metric transformations, and image classification should be invariant (figure 10.1). Here, convolutional and pooling layers partially achieve this with respect to translations, but there is no known way to guarantee these properties exactly for more general transfor- mations. However, for graphs, it is possible to define networks that ensure equivariance or invariance to permutations.\n",

Instead, we used convolutional layers that processed every position in the image identically. This reduced the number of parameters and introduced an inductive bias that forced the model to treat every part of the image in the same way. The same argument can be made about nodes in a graph. We could learn a model with separate parameters associated with each node. However, now the network must independently learn the meaning of the connections in the graph at each position, and training would require many graphs with the same topology. Instead, we build a model that uses the same parameters at every node, reducing the number of parameters and sharing what the network learns at each node across the entire graph. Recall that a convolution (equation 10.3) updates a variable by taking a weighted sum of information from its neighbors. One way to think of this is that each neighbor sends a message to the variable of interest, which aggregates these messages to form the update. When we considered images, the neighbors were pixels from a fixed-size square region around the current position, so the spatial relationships at each position are the same.

It does not produce a rule but merely a labeling for the unknown outputs. This is sometimes termed semi-supervised learning. It has the advantage that it can use patterns in the unlabeled data to help make its decisions. However, it has the disadvantage that the model needs to be retrained when extra unlabeled data are added. Both problem types are commonly encountered for graphs (figure 13.8). Sometimes, we have many labeled graphs and learn a mapping between the graph and the labels. For example, we might have many molecules, each labeled according to whether it is toxic to humans. We learn the rule that maps the graph to the toxic/non-toxic label and then apply this rule to new molecules. However, sometimes there is a single monolithic graph. In the graph of scientific paper citations, we might have labels indicating the field (physics, biology, etc.) for some nodes and wish to label the remaining nodes.

However, node-level tasks and edge prediction tasks can occur in either setting.

Consider the orange node in hidden layer two (right). This receives input from the nodes in the 1-hop neighborhood in hidden layer one (shaded region in center). These nodes in hidden layer one receive inputs from their neighbors in turn, and the orange node in layer two receives inputs from all the input nodes in the 2-hop neighborhood (shaded area on left). The region of the graph that contributes to a given node is equivalent to the notion of a receptive field in convolutional neural networks. on their neighbors in the layer before, so each node has the equivalent of a receptive field (figure 13.9). The size of the receptive field is termed the k-hop neighborhood. We can hence perform a gradient descent step using the graph that forms the union of the k-hop neighborhoods of the batch nodes; the remaining inputs do not contribute. Unfortunately, if there are many layers and the graph is densely connected, every input node may be in the receptive field of every output, and this may not reduce the graph size at all. This is known as the graph expansion problem. Two approaches that tackle this problem are neighborhood sampling and graph partitioning. Neighborhood sampling: The full graph that feeds into the batch of nodes is sampled, thereby reducing the connections at each network layer (figure 13.10). For example, we might start with the batch nodes and randomly sample a fixed number of their neighbors Notebook 13.3 Neighborhood sampling in the previous layer. Then, we randomly sample a fixed number of their neighbors in the layer before, and so on. The graph still increases in size with each layer but in a much more controlled way. This is done anew for each batch, so the contributing neighbors differ even if the same batch is drawn twice. This is also reminiscent of dropout (section 9.3.3) and adds some regularization. Graph partitioning: A second approach is to cluster the original graph into disjoint subsets of nodes (i.e., smaller graphs that are not connected to one another) before processing (figure 13.11). There are standard algorithms to choose these subsets to maximize the number of internal links. These smaller graphs can each be treated as batches, or a random subset of them can be combined to form a batch (reinstating any edges between them from the original graph).

Only this sub-graph is needed to train this batch. Unfortunately, if the graph is densely connected, this may retain a large proportion of the graph. b) One solution is neighborhood sampling. As we work back from the final layer, we select a subset of neighbors (here, three) in the layer before and a subset of the neighbors of these in the layer before that.

Both nodes and edges can have data attached, and these are referred to as node embeddings and edge embeddings, respectively. Many real-world problems can be framed in terms of graphs, where the goal is to establish a property of the entire graph, properties of each node or edge, or the presence of additional edges in the graph. Graph neural networks are deep learning models that are applied to graphs. Since the node order in graphs is arbitrary, the layers of graph neural networks must be equivariant to permutations of the node indices. Spatial-based convolutional networks are a family of graph neural networks that aggregate information from the neighbors of a node and then use this to update the node embeddings. One challenge of processing graphs is that they often occur in the transductive setting, where there is only one partially labeled graph rather than sets of training and test graphs. This graph can be extremely large, which adds further challenges in terms of training and has led to sampling and partitioning algorithms. The edge graph has a node for every edge in the original graph. By converting to this representation, graph neural networks can be used to update the edge embeddings. Notes Sanchez-Lengeling et al. (2021) and Daigavane et al. (2021) present good introductory articles on graph processing using neural networks. Recent surveys of research in graph neural networks can be found in articles by Zhou et al. (2020a), Wu et al. (2020c), and Veličković (2023), and the books of Hamilton (2020) and Ma & Tang (2021).

In this chapter, we have related graphs to convolutional networks following Bruna et al. (2013), but there are also strong connections with belief propagation (Dai et al., 2016) and graph isomorphism tests (Hamilton et al., 2017a). Zhang et al. (2019c) provide a review focusing specifically on graph convolutional networks. Bronstein et al. (2021) provide a general overview of geometric deep learning, including learning on graphs. Loukas (2020) discusses what types of functions graph neural networks can learn. Applications: Applications include graph classification (e.g., Zhang et al., 2018b), node clas- sification (e.g., Kipf & Welling, 2017), edge prediction (e.g., Zhang & Chen, 2018), graph clus- tering (e.g., Tsitsulin et al., 2020), and recommender systems (e.g., Wu et al., 2023). Methods for node classification are reviewed by Xiao et al. (2022a), methods for graph classification by Errica et al. (2019), and methods for edge prediction by Mutlu et al. (2020) and Kumar et al. (2020a). Graph neural networks: Graph neural networks were introduced by Gori et al. (2005) and Scarselli et al. (2008), who formulated them as a generalization of recursive neural networks. The latter model used the iterative update: hn ←f \u0002 xn, xm∈ne[n], ee∈nee[n], hm∈ne[n], ϕ \u0003 , (13.25) in which each node embedding hn is updated from the initial embedding xn, initial embed- dings xm∈ne[n] at the adjacent nodes, initial embeddings ee∈nee[n] at the adjacent edges, and adjacent node embeddings hm∈ne[n]. For convergence, the function f[•, •, •, •, ϕ] must be a contraction mapping (see figure 16.9). If we unroll this equation in time for K steps and allow different parameters ϕk at each time K, then equation 13.25 becomes similar to the graph con- volutional network. Subsequent work extended graph neural networks to use gated recurrent units (Li et al., 2016b) and long short-term memory networks (Selsam et al., 2019). Spectral methods: Bruna et al. (2013) applied the convolution operation in the Fourier domain. The Fourier basis vectors can be found by taking the eigendecomposition of the graph Laplacian matrix, L = D −A where D is the degree matrix and A is the adjacency matrix. This has disadvantages: the filters are not localized, and the decomposition is prohibitively expensive for large graphs. Henaff et al. (2015) tackled the first problem by forcing the Fourier representation to be smooth (and hence the spatial domain to be localized). Defferrard et al. (2016) introduced ChebNet, which approximates the filters eﬀiciently by using the recursive properties of Chebyshev polynomials. This both provides spatially localized filters and reduces the computation. Kipf & Welling (2017) simplified this further to construct filters that use only a 1-hop neighborhood, resulting in a formulation similar to the spatial methods described in this chapter and providing a bridge between spectral and spatial methods. Spatial methods: Spectral methods are ultimately based on the Graph Laplacian, so if the graph changes, the model must be retrained. This problem spurred the development of spatial methods. Duvenaud et al. (2015) defined convolutions in the spatial domain, using a different weight matrix to combine the adjacent embeddings for each node degree. This has the disad- vantage that it becomes impractical if some nodes have a very large number of connections. Diffusion convolutional neural networks (Atwood & Towsley, 2016) use powers of the normal- ized adjacency matrix to blend features across different scales, sum these, pointwise multiply by weights, and pass through an activation function to create the node embeddings. Gilmer et al. (2017) introduced message-passing neural networks, which defined convolutions on the graph as propagating messages from spatial neighbors. The “aggregate and combine” formulation of GraphSAGE (Hamilton et al., 2017a) fits into this framework. This work is subject to a Creative Commons CC-BY-NC-ND license. (C) MIT Press. Notes 263 Aggregate and combine: Graph convolutional networks (Kipf & Welling, 2017) take a weighted average of the neighbors and current node and then apply a linear mapping and ReLU. GraphSAGE (Hamilton et al., 2017a) applies a neural network layer to each neighbor, taking the elementwise maximum to aggregate. Chiang et al. (2019) propose diagonal enhance- ment in which the previous embedding is weighted more than the neighbors. Kipf & Welling (2017) introduced Kipf normalization, which normalizes the sum of the neighboring embeddings based on the degrees of the current node and its neighbors (see equation 13.19). The mixture model network or MoNet (Monti et al., 2017) takes this one step further by learning a weighting based on the degrees of the current node and the neighbor. They associate a pseudo- coordinate system with each node, where the positions of the neighbors depend on these two quantities. They then learn a continuous function based on a mixture of Gaussians and sample this at the pseudo-coordinates of the neighbors to get the weights. In this way, they can learn the weightings for nodes and neighbors with arbitrary degrees. Pham et al. (2017) use a linear interpolation of the node embedding and neighbors with a different weighted combination for each dimension. The weight of this gating mechanism is generated as a function of the data. Higher-order convolutional layers: Zhou & Li (2017) used higher-order convolutions by replacing the adjacency matrix A with ˜ A = Min[AL + I, 1] where L is the maximum walk- length, 1 is a matrix containing only ones, and Min[•] takes the pointwise minimum of its two matrix arguments; the updates now sum together contributions from any nodes where there is at least one walk of length L. Abu-El-Haija et al. (2019) proposed MixHop, which computes node updates from the neighbors (using the adjacency matrix A), the neighbors of the neighbors (using A2), and so on. They concatenate these updates at each layer. Lee et al. (2018) combined information from nodes beyond the immediate neighbors using geometric motifs, which are small local geometric patterns in the graph (e.g., a fully connected clique of five nodes). Residual connections: Kipf & Welling (2017) proposed a residual connection in which the original embeddings are added to the updated ones. Hamilton et al. (2017b) concatenate the previous embedding to the output of the next layer (see equation 13.16). Rossi et al. (2020) present an inception-style network where the node embedding is concatenated to not only the aggregation of its neighbors but also the aggregation of all neighbors within a walk of two (via computing powers of the adjacency matrix). Xu et al. (2018) introduced jump knowledge con- nections in which the final output at each node consists of the concatenated node embeddings throughout the network. Zhang & Meng (2019) present a general formulation of residual em- beddings called GResNet and investigate several variations in which the embeddings from the previous layer are added, the input embeddings are added, or versions of these that aggregate information from their neighbors (without further transformation) are added. Attention in graph neural networks: Veličković et al. (2019) developed the graph attention network (figure 13.12c). Their formulation uses multiple heads whose outputs are combined symmetrically. Gated Attention Networks (Zhang et al., 2018a) weight the output of the different heads in a way that depends on the data itself. Graph-BERT (Zhang et al., 2020) performs node classification using self-attention alone; the graph’s structure is captured by adding position embeddings to the data, similarly to how the absolute or relative position of words is captured in the transformer (chapter 12). For example, they add positional information that depends on the number of hops between nodes in the graph. Permutation invariance: In DeepSets, Zaheer et al. (2017) presented a general permutation invariant operator for processing sets. Janossy pooling (Murphy et al., 2018) accepts that many functions are not permutation equivariant and instead uses a permutation-sensitive function and averages the results across many permutations. Draft: please send errata to udlbookmail@gmail.com. 264 13 Graph neural networks Edge graphs: The notation of the edge graph, line graph, or adjoint graph dates to Whitney (1932). The idea of “weaving” layers that update node embeddings from node embeddings, node embeddings from edge embeddings, edge embeddings from edge embeddings, and edge embeddings from node embeddings was proposed by Kearnes et al. (2016). However, here the node-node and edge-edge updates do not involve the neighbors. Monti et al. (2018) introduced the dual-primal graph CNN, a modern formulation in a CNN framework that alternates between updates in the original and edge graphs. Power of graph neural networks: Xu et al. (2019) argue that a neural network should be able to distinguish different graph structures; it is undesirable to map two graphs to the same output if they have the same initial node embeddings but different adjacency matrices. They identified graph structures that could not be distinguished by previous approaches such as GCNs (Kipf & Welling, 2017) and GraphSAGE (Hamilton et al., 2017a). They developed a more powerful architecture with the same discriminative power as the Weisfeiler-Lehman graph isomorphism test (Weisfeiler & Leman, 1968), which is known to discriminate a broad class of graphs. This resulting graph isomorphism network was based on the aggregation operation: h(n) k+1 = mlp  (1 + ϵk) h(n) k + X m∈ne[n] h(m) k  . (13.26) Batches: The original paper on graph convolutional networks (Kipf & Welling, 2017) used full- batch gradient descent. This has memory requirements proportional to the number of nodes, embedding size, and number of layers during training. Since then, three types of methods have been proposed to reduce the memory requirements and create batches for SGD in the transductive setting: node sampling, layer sampling, and sub-graph sampling. Node sampling methods start by randomly selecting a subset of target nodes and then work back through the network, adding a subset of the nodes in the receptive field at each stage. GraphSAGE (Hamilton et al., 2017a) proposed a fixed number of neighborhood samples as in figure 13.10b. Chen et al. (2018b) introduce a variance reduction technique, but this uses historical activations of nodes and so still has a high memory requirement. PinSAGE (Ying et al., 2018a) uses random walks from the target nodes and chooses the K nodes with the highest visit count. This prioritizes ancestors that are more closely connected. Node sampling still requires increasing numbers of nodes as we pass back through the graph. Layer sampling methods address this by directly sampling the receptive field in each layer independently. Examples of layer sampling include FastGCN (Chen et al., 2018a), adaptive sampling (Huang et al., 2018b), and layer-dependent importance sampling (Zou et al., 2019). Subgraph sampling methods randomly draw subgraphs or divide the original graph into sub- graphs. These are then trained as independent data examples. Examples of these approaches include GraphSAINT (Zeng et al., 2020), which samples sub-graphs during training using ran- dom walks and then runs a full GCN on the subgraph while also correcting for the bias and variance of the minibatch. Cluster GCN (Chiang et al., 2019) partitions the graph into clusters (by maximizing the embedding utilization or number of within-batch edges) in a pre-processing stage and randomly selects clusters to form minibatches. To create more randomness, they train random subsets of these clusters plus the edges between them (see figure 13.11). Wolfe et al. (2021) proposed a distributed training method that both partitions the graph and trains narrower GCNs in parallel by partitioning the feature space at different layers. More information about sampling graphs can be found in Rozemberczki et al. (2020). Regularization and normalization: Rong et al. (2020) proposed DropEdge, which randomly drops edges from the graph during each training iteration by masking the adjacency matrix. This This work is subject to a Creative Commons CC-BY-NC-ND license. (C) MIT Press. Notes 265 can be done for the whole neural network or differently in each layer (layer-wise DropEdge). In a sense, this is similar to dropout in that it breaks connections in the flow of data, but it can also be considered an augmentation method since changing the graph is similar to perturbing the data. Schlichtkrull et al. (2018), Teru et al. (2020), and Veličković et al. (2019) also proposed randomly dropping edges from the graph as a form of regularization similar to dropout. Node sampling methods (Hamilton et al., 2017a; Huang et al., 2018b; Chen et al., 2018a) can also be considered regularizers. Hasanzadeh et al. (2020) present a general framework called DropConnect that unifies many of the above approaches. There are also many proposed normalization schemes for graph neural networks, including PairNorm (Zhao & Akoglu, 2020), weight normalization (Oono & Suzuki, 2019), differentiable group normalization (Zhou et al., 2020b), and GraphNorm (Cai et al., 2021). Multi-relational graphs: Schlichtkrull et al. (2018) proposed a variation of graph convolu- tional networks for multi-relational graphs (i.e., graphs with more than one edge type). Their scheme separately aggregates information from each edge type using different parameters. If there are many edge types, the number of parameters may become large, and to combat this, they propose that each edge type uses a different weighting of a basis set of parameters. Hierarchical representations and pooling: CNNs for image classification gradually de- crease the representation size but increase the number of channels as the network progresses. However, the GCNs for graph classification in this chapter maintain the entire graph until the last layer and then combine all the nodes to compute the final prediction. Ying et al. (2018b) proposed DiffPool, which clusters graph nodes to make a graph that gets progressively smaller as the depth increases in a way that is differentiable, and so can be learned. This can be done based on the graph structure alone or adaptively based on the graph structure and the embed- dings. Other pooling methods include SortPool (Zhang et al., 2018b) and self-attention graph pooling (Lee et al., 2019). A comparison of pooling layers for graph neural networks can be found in Grattarola et al. (2022). Gao & Ji (2019) propose an encoder-decoder structure for graphs based on the U-Net (see figure 11.10). Geometric graphs: The MoNet model (Monti et al., 2017) can exploit geometric information because neighboring nodes have well-defined spatial positions. They learn a mixture of Gaus- sians function and sample from this based on the relative coordinates of the neighbor. In this way, they can weight neighboring nodes based on their relative positions as in standard convolu- tional neural networks, even though these positions are not constant. The geodesic CNN (Masci et al., 2015) and anisotropic CNN (Boscaini et al., 2016) both adapt convolution to manifolds (i.e., surfaces) as represented by triangular meshes. They locally approximate the surface as a plane and define a coordinate system on this plane around the current node. Oversmoothing and suspended animation: Unlike other deep learning models, graph neu- ral networks did not, until recently, benefit significantly from increasing depth. Indeed, the orig- inal GCN paper (Kipf & Welling, 2017) and GraphSAGE (Hamilton et al., 2017a) both only use two layers, and Chiang et al. (2019) trained a five-layer Cluster-GCN to get state-of-the-art performance on the PPI dataset. One possible explanation is over-smoothing (Li et al., 2018c); at each layer, the network incorporates information from a larger neighborhood, and it may be that this ultimately results in the dissolution of (important) local information. Indeed (Xu et al., 2018) prove that the influence of one node on another is proportional to the probability of reaching that node in a K-step random walk. This approaches the stationary distribution of walks over the graph with increasing K, causing the local neighborhood to be washed out. Alon & Yahav (2021) proposed another explanation for why performance doesn’t improve with network depth. They argue that adding depth allows information to be aggregated from longer paths. However, in practice, the exponential growth in the number of neighbors means there is a bottleneck whereby too much information is “squashed” into the fixed-size node embeddings.

(2018a) also note that when the depth of the network exceeds a certain limit, the gradients no longer propagate back, and learning fails for both the training and test data. They term this effect suspended animation. This is similar to when many layers are naïvely added to convolutional neural networks (figure 11.2). They propose a family of residual connections that allow deeper networks to be trained. Vanishing gradients (section 7.5) have also been identified as a limitation by Li et al. (2021b). It has recently become possible to train deeper graph neural networks using various forms of residual connection (Xu et al., 2018; Li et al., 2020a; Gong et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2020b; Xu et al., 2021a). Li et al. (2021a) train a state-of-the-art model with more than 1000 layers using an invertible network to reduce the memory requirements of training (see chapter 16).

Chapter 14 Unsupervised learning Chapters 2–9 walked through the supervised learning pipeline. We defined models that mapped observed data x to output values y and introduced loss functions that measured the quality of that mapping for a training dataset {xi, yi}. Then we discussed how to fit and measure the performance of these models. Chapters 10–13 introduced more sophisticated model architectures incorporating parameter sharing and allowing parallel computational paths. The defining characteristic of unsupervised learning models is that they are learned from a set of observed data {xi} in the absence of labels. All unsupervised models share this property, but they have diverse goals. They may be used to generate plausible new samples from the dataset or to manipulate, denoise, interpolate between, or compress examples. They can also be used to reveal the internal structure of a dataset (e.g., by dividing it into coherent clusters) or to distinguish whether new examples belong to the same dataset or are outliers. This chapter introduces a taxonomy of unsupervised learning models and then dis- cusses the desirable properties of models and how to measure their performance. The four subsequent chapters discuss four particular models: generative adversarial networks (GANs), variational autoencoders (VAEs), normalizing flows, and diffusion models.1\n",

Generative models can synthesize (generate) new examples with similar statistics to the training data. A subset of these are probabilistic and de- fine a distribution over the data. We draw samples from this distribution to generate new examples. Latent vari- able models define a mapping between an underlying explanatory (latent) vari- able and the data. They may fall into any of the above categories. famous k-means algorithm maps the data x to a cluster assignment z ∈{1, 2, . . . , K}. Other models map from the latent variables z to the data x. Consider defining a dis- tribution Pr(z) over the latent variable z in these models. New examples can now be generated by (i) drawing from this distribution and (ii) mapping the sample to the data space x. Accordingly, these are termed generative models (see figure 14.1). The four models in chapters 15 to 18 are all generative models that use latent vari- ables. Generative adversarial networks (chapter 15) learn to generate data examples x∗ from latent variables z, using a loss that encourages the generated samples to be indis- tinguishable from real examples (figure 14.2a). Normalizing flows, variational autoencoders, and diffusion models (chapters 16–18) are probabilistic generative models. In addition to generating new examples, they assign a probability Pr(x|ϕ) to each data point x. This will depend on the model parameters ϕ, and in training, we maximize the probability of the observed data {xi}, so the loss is the sum of the negative log-likelihoods (figure 14.2b): L[ϕ] = − I X i=1 log h Pr(xi|ϕ) i . (14.1) Since probability distributions must sum to one, this implicitly reduces the probability of examples that lie far from the observed data. As well as providing a training criterion, assigning probabilities is useful in its own right; the probability on a test set can be used to compare two models quantitatively, and the probability for an example can be thresholded to determine if it belongs to the same dataset or is an outlier.2\n",

As training proceeds (left to right), the loss function encourages these samples to become progressively less distinguishable from real examples (cyan points). b) Probabilistic models (in- cluding variational autoencoders, normalizing flows, and diffusion models) learn a probability distribution over the training data. As training proceeds (left to right), the likelihood of the real examples increases under this distribution, which can be used to draw new samples and assess the probability of new data points. • Eﬀicient sampling: Generating samples from the model should be computation- ally inexpensive and take advantage of the parallelism of modern hardware. • High-quality sampling: The samples should be indistinguishable from the real data with which the model was trained. • Coverage: Samples should represent the entire training distribution. It is insuf- ficient to generate samples that all look like a subset of the training examples. • Well-behaved latent space: Every latent variable z corresponds to a plausible data example x. Smooth changes in z correspond to smooth changes in x. • Disentangled latent space: Manipulating each dimension of z should correspond to changing an interpretable property of the data. For example, in a model of language, it might change the topic, tense, or verbosity. • Eﬀicient likelihood computation: If the model is probabilistic, we would like to be able to calculate the probability of new examples eﬀiciently and accurately. This naturally leads to the question of whether the generative models that we consider satisfy these properties. The answer is subjective, but figure 14.3 provides guidance. The precise assignments are disputable, but most practitioners would agree that there is no single model that satisfies all of these characteristics.

More precisely, it returns the exponential of the expected KL-divergence Appendix C.5.1 KL divergence between Pr(yi|x∗ i ) and Pr(y): IS = exp \" 1 I I X i=1 DKL h Pr(yi|x∗ i )||Pr(y) i# , (14.2) where I is the number of generated examples and: Pr(y) = 1 I I X i=1 Pr(yi|x∗ i ). (14.3) This metric is only sensible for generative models of the ImageNet database and is sensitive to the particular classification model; retraining this model can give quite different numerical results. Moreover, it does not reward diversity within an object class; it returns a high value if the model only generates one realistic example of each class. Fréchet inception distance: This measure is also intended for images and computes a symmetric distance between the distributions of generated samples and real examples. This must be approximate since it is hard to characterize either distribution (indeed, This work is subject to a Creative Commons CC-BY-NC-ND license. (C) MIT Press. 14.4 Summary 273 characterizing the distribution of real examples is the job of generative models in the first place). Hence, the Fréchet inception distance approximates both distributions by Appendix C.5.4 Fréchet distance multivariate Gaussians and (as the name suggests) estimates the distance between them using the Fréchet distance. However, it does not model the distance with respect to the original data but rather the activations in the deepest layer of the inception classification network. These hidden units are the ones most associated with object classes, so the comparison occurs at a semantic level, ignoring the more fine-grained details of the images. This metric does take account of diversity within classes but relies heavily on the information retained by the features in the inception network; any information discarded by the network does not contribute to the result. Some of this discarded information may still be important to generate realistic samples. Manifold precision/recall: Fréchet inception distance is sensitive both to the realism of the samples and their diversity but does not distinguish between these factors. To disentangle these qualities, we consider the overlap between the data manifold (i.e., the subset of the data space where the real examples lie) and the model manifold (i.e., where the generated samples lie). The precision is the fraction of model samples that fall into the data manifold. This measures the proportion of generated samples that are realistic. The recall is the fraction of data examples that fall within the model manifold. This measures the proportion of the real data the model can generate (figure 14.5). To estimate the manifold, we place a hypersphere around each data example, whose radius is the distance to the kth nearest neighbor. The union of these spheres is an approximation of the manifold, and it’s easy to determine if a new point lies within it. This manifold is also typically computed in the feature space of a classifier with the advantages and disadvantages that entails.\n",

Chapter 15 Generative Adversarial Networks A generative adversarial network or GAN is an unsupervised model that aims to generate new samples that are indistinguishable from a set of training examples. GANs are just mechanisms to create new samples; they do not build a probability distribution over the modeled data and hence cannot evaluate the probability that a new data point belongs to the same distribution. In a GAN, the main generator network creates samples by mapping random noise to the output data space. If a second discriminator network cannot distinguish between the generated samples and the real examples, the samples must be plausible. If this network can tell the difference, this provides a training signal that can be fed back to improve the quality of the samples. This idea is simple, but training GANs is diﬀicult: the learning algorithm can be unstable, and although GANs may learn to generate realistic samples, this does not imply that they learn to generate all possible samples. GANs have been applied to many types of data, including audio, 3D models, text, video, and graphs. However, they have found the most success in the image domain, where they can produce samples that are almost indistinguishable from real pictures. Accordingly, the examples in this chapter focus on synthesizing images.\n",

However, there is a potential problem with using this distance between probability distributions as the criterion for optimizing GANs. If the probability distributions are completely disjoint, this distance is infinite, and any small change to the generator will not decrease the loss. The same phenomenon can be seen when we consider the original formulation; if the discriminator can perfectly separate the generated and real samples, no small change to the generated data will change the classification score (figure 15.6). Unfortunately, the distributions of generated samples and real examples may really be disjoint; the generated samples lie in a subspace that is the size of the latent variable z, and the real examples also lie in a low-dimensional subspace due to the physical processes that created the data (figure 1.9). There may be little or no overlap between these subspaces, and the result is very small or no gradients. Figure 15.7 provides empirical evidence to support this hypothesis. If the DCGAN generator is frozen and the discriminator is updated repeatedly so that its classification performance improves, the generator gradients decrease.

The discriminator also has extra layers added to it so that it can receive the higher-resolution images and classify them as either being generated samples or real examples. In practice, the higher-resolution layers gradually “fade in” over time; initially, the higher-resolution image is an upsampled version of the previous result, passed via a residual connection, and the new layers gradually take over. Mini-batch discrimination ensures that the samples have suﬀicient variety and hence helps prevent mode collapse. This can be done by computing feature statistics across the mini-batches of synthesized and real data. These can be summarized and added as a feature map (usually toward the end of the discriminator). This allows the discriminator to send a signal back to the generator, encouraging it to include a similar amount of variation in the synthesized data as in the original dataset. Another trick to improve generation results is truncation (figure 15.10), in which only latent variables z with high probability (i.e., close to the mean) are chosen during sampling. This reduces the variation in the samples but improves their quality. Careful Problem 15.6 normalization and regularization schemes also improve sample quality. Using combina- tions of these methods, GANs can synthesize varied and realistic images (figure 15.11). Moving smoothly through the latent space can also sometimes produce realistic interpo- lations from one synthesized image to another (figure 15.12).\n",

These responses are averaged to provide the final output. One way to think of this model is that it is a conditional GAN where the U-Net is the generator and is conditioned on an image rather than a label. Notice, though, that the U-Net input does not include noise and so is not really a “generator” in the conventional sense.

This has the disadvantage that we need ground truth before/after pairs to exploit the discriminator loss. Fortunately, there is a simpler way to exploit the power of adversarial discriminators in the context of supervised learning without the need for additional labeled training data. An adversarial loss adds a penalty if a discriminator can distinguish the output of a supervised network from a real example from its output domain. Accordingly, the supervised model changes its predictions to decrease this penalty. This may be done at the scale of the entire output or at the level of patches, as in the Pix2Pix algorithm. This helps improve the realism of complex structured outputs. However, it doesn’t necessarily lead to a better solution in terms of the original loss function. The super-resolution GAN or SRGAN uses this approach (figure 15.17). The main model consists of a convolutional network with residual connections that ingests a low- resolution image and converts this via upsampling layers to a high-resolution image. The network is trained with three losses. The content loss measures the squared difference between the output and the true high-resolution image. The VGG loss or perceptual loss passes the synthesized and ground truth outputs through the VGG network and measures the squared difference between their activations. This encourages the image to be semantically similar to the target. Finally, the adversarial loss uses a discriminator that attempts to distinguish whether this is a real high-resolution image or an upsampled one.

The main generative branch of StyleGAN starts with a learned constant 4×4 repre- sentation with 512 channels. This passes through a series of convolutional layers that gradually upsample the representation to generate the image at its final resolution. Two sets of random latent variables representing style and noise are introduced at each scale; the closer that they are to the output, the finer scale details they represent. The latent variables that represent noise are independently sampled Gaussian vec- tors z1, z2 . . . and are injected additively after each convolution operation in the main generative pipeline.

(2021) present a review of GAN models that focuses on computer vision applications. Hindupur (2022) maintains a list of named GAN models (numbering 501 at the time of writing) from ABC-GAN (Susmelj et al., 2017) right through to ZipNet-GAN (Zhang et al., 2017b). Odena (2019) lists open problems concerning GANs. Data: GANs have primarily been developed for image data. Examples include the deep con- volutional GAN (Radford et al., 2015), progressive GAN (Karras et al., 2018), and StyleGAN (Karras et al., 2019) models presented in this chapter. For this reason, most GANs are based on convolutional layers, although more recently, GANs that exploit transformers in the generator and discriminator to capture long-range correlations have been developed (e.g., SAGAN, Zhang et al., 2019b). However, GANs have also been used to generate molecular graphs (De Cao & Kipf, 2018), voice data (Saito et al., 2017; Donahue et al., 2018b; Kaneko & Kameoka, 2017; Fang et al., 2018), EEG data (Hartmann et al., 2018), text (Lin et al., 2017a; Fedus et al., 2018), music (Mogren, 2016; Guimaraes et al., 2017; Yu et al., 2017), 3D models (Wu et al., 2016), DNA (Killoran et al., 2017), and video data (Vondrick et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2018a). GAN loss functions: It was originally claimed that GANs converged to Nash equilibria during training. However, more recent evidence suggests that this isn’t always the case (Farnia & Ozdaglar, 2020; Jin et al., 2020; Berard et al., 2019). (Arjovsky et al., 2017; Metz et al., 2017; Qi, 2020) identified that the original GAN loss function was unstable, and this led to different formulations. Mao et al. (2017) introduced the least squares GAN. For some parameter choices, this implicitly minimizes the Pearson χ2 divergence. Nowozin et al. (2016) argue that the Jensen-Shannon divergence is a special case of a larger family of f-divergences and show that any f-divergence can be used for training GANs. Jolicoeur-Martineau (2019) introduces the relativistic GAN in which the discriminator estimates the probability that a real data example is more realistic than a generated one rather than the absolute probability that it is real. Zhao et al. (2017a) reformulate the GAN into a general energy-based framework in which the discriminator is a function that attributes low energies to real data and higher energies elsewhere. As an example, they use an autoencoder and base the energy on reconstruction error. Arjovsky & Bottou (2017) analyzed vanishing gradients in GANs, and this led to the Wasserstein GAN (Arjovsky et al., 2017), which is based on earth mover’s distance/optimal transport. The Wasserstein formulation requires that the Lipschitz constant of the discriminator is less than one; the original paper proposed to clip the weights in the discriminator, but subsequent work imposed a gradient penalty (Gulrajani et al., 2016) or applied spectral normalization (Miyato et al., 2018) to limit the Lipschitz constant. Other variations of the Wasserstein GAN were introduced by Wu et al. (2018a), Bellemare et al. (2017b), and Adler & Lunz (2018). Hermann (2017) presents an excellent blog post discussing duality and the Wasserstein GAN. For more information about optimal transport, consult the book by Peyré et al. (2019). Lucic et al. (2018) present an empirical comparison of GAN loss functions of the time. Tricks for training GANs: Many heuristics improve the stability of training GANs and the quality of the final results. Marchesi (2017) first used the truncation trick (figure 15.10) to trade off the variability of GAN outputs relative to their quality. This was also proposed by Pieters & Wiering (2018) and Brock et al. (2019), who added a regularizer that encourages the weight matrices in the generator to be orthogonal. This means that truncating the latent variable has a closer relationship to truncating the output variance and improves sample quality. Other tricks include only using the gradients from the top K most realistic images (Sinha et al., 2020), label smoothing in the discriminator (Salimans et al., 2016), updating the discriminator using a history of generated images rather than the ones produced by the latest generator to avoid model “oscillation” (Salimans et al., 2016), and adding noise to the discriminator input (Arjovsky & Bottou, 2017). Kurach et al. (2019) present an overview of normalization and regularization in GANs. Chintala et al. (2020) provide further suggestions for training GANs. Draft: please send errata to udlbookmail@gmail.com. 300 15 Generative Adversarial Networks Sample diversity: The original GAN paper (Goodfellow et al., 2014) argued that given enough capacity, training samples, and computation time, a GAN can learn to minimize the Jensen-Shannon divergence between the generated samples and the true distribution. However, subsequent work has cast doubt on whether this happens in practice. Arora et al. (2017) sug- gest that the finite capacity of the discriminator means that the GAN training objective can approach its optimum value even when the variation in the output distribution is limited. Wu et al. (2017) approximated the log-likelihoods of the distributions produced by GANs using an- nealed importance sampling and found a mismatch between the generated and real distributions. Arora & Zhang (2017) ask human observers to identify GAN samples that are (near-)duplicates and infer the diversity of images from the frequency of these duplicates. They found that for DCGAN, a duplicate occurs with probability >50% with 400 samples; this implies that the support size was ∼400, 000, which is smaller than the training set. They also showed that the diversity increased as a function of the discriminator size. Bau et al. (2019) take a different approach and investigate the parts of the data space that GANs cannot generate. Increasing diversity and preventing mode collapse: The extreme case of lack of diversity is mode collapse, in which the network repeatedly produces the same image (Salimans et al., 2016). This is a particular problem for conditional GANs, where the latent variable is sometimes completely ignored, and the output depends only on the conditional information. Mao et al. (2019) introduce a regularization term to help prevent mode collapse in conditional GANs, which maximizes the ratio of the distance between generated images with respect to the corresponding latent variables and hence encourages diversity in the outputs. Other work that aims to reduce mode collapse includes VEEGAN (Srivastava et al., 2017), which introduces a reconstruction network that maps the generated image back to the original noise and hence discourages many- to-one mappings from noise to images. Salimans et al. (2016) suggested computing statistics across the mini-batch and using the dis- criminator to ensure that these are indistinguishable from the statistics of batches of real images. This is known as mini-batch discrimination and is implemented by adding a layer toward the end of the discriminator that learns a tensor for each image that captures the statistics of the batch. This was simplified by Karras et al. (2018), who computed a standard deviation for each feature in each spatial location over the mini-batch. Then they average over spatial locations and features to get a single estimate. This is replicated to get a single feature map, which is appended to a layer near the end of the discriminator network. Lin et al. (2018) pass concate- nated (real or generated) samples to the discriminator and provide a theoretical analysis of how presenting multiple samples to the discriminator increases diversity. MAD-GAN (Ghosh et al., 2018) increases the diversity of GAN samples by using multiple generators and requiring the single discriminator to identify which generator created the samples, thus providing a signal to help push the generators to create different samples from one another. Multiple scales: Wang et al. (2018b) used multiple discriminators at different scales to help ensure that image quality is high in all frequency bands. Other work defined both generators and discriminators at different resolutions (Denton et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2017d; Huang et al., 2017c). Karras et al. (2018) introduced the progressive growing method (figure 15.9), which is somewhat simpler and faster to train. StyleGAN: Karras et al. (2019) introduced the StyleGAN framework (section 15.6). In sub- sequent work (Karras et al., 2020b), they improved the quality of generated images by (i) redesigning the normalization layers in the generator to remove “water droplet” artifacts and (ii) reducing artifacts where fine details do not follow the coarse details by changing the pro- gressive growing framework. Further improvements include developing methods to train GANs with limited data (Karras et al., 2020a) and fixing aliasing artifacts (Karras et al., 2021). A large body of work finds and manipulates the latent variables in the StyleGAN to edit images (e.g., Abdal et al., 2021; Collins et al., 2020; Härkönen et al., 2020; Patashnik et al., 2021; Shen et al., 2020b; Tewari et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2021; Roich et al., 2022).

Notes 301 Conditional GANs: The conditional GAN was developed by Mirza & Osindero (2014), the auxiliary classifier GAN by Odena et al. (2017), and the InfoGAN by Chen et al. (2016b). The discriminators of these models usually append the conditional information to the discriminator input (Mirza & Osindero, 2014; Denton et al., 2015; Saito et al., 2017) or to an intermediate hidden layer in the discriminator (Reed et al., 2016a; Zhang et al., 2017d; Perarnau et al., 2016). However, Miyato & Koyama (2018) experimented with taking the inner product between embedded conditional information with a layer of the discriminator, motivated by the role of the class information in the underlying probabilistic model. Images generated by GANs have variously been conditioned on classes (e.g., Odena et al., 2017), input text (Reed et al., 2016a; Zhang et al., 2017d), attributes (Yan et al., 2016; Donahue et al., 2018a; Xiao et al., 2018b), bounding boxes and keypoints (Reed et al., 2016b), and images (e.g., Isola et al., 2017)). Image translation: Isola et al. (2017) developed the Pix2Pix algorithm (figure 15.16), and a similar system with higher-resolution results was subsequently developed by Wang et al. (2018b). StarGAN (Choi et al., 2018) performs image-to-image translation across multiple domains using only a single model. The idea of cycle consistency loss was introduced by Zhou et al. (2016b) in DiscoGAN and Zhu et al. (2017) in CycleGAN (figure 15.18). Adversarial loss: In many image translation tasks, there is no “generator”; such models can be considered supervised learning tasks with an adversarial loss that encourages realism. The super-resolution algorithm of Ledig et al. (2017) is a good example of this (figure 15.17). Esser et al. (2021) used an autoencoder with an adversarial loss. This network takes an image, reduces the representation size to create a “bottleneck,” and then reconstructs the image from this reduced data space. In practice, the architecture is similar to encoder-decoder networks (e.g., figure 10.19). After training, the autoencoder reproduces something that is both close to the image and looks highly realistic. They vector quantize (discretize) the bottleneck of the autoencoder and then learn a probability distribution over the discrete variables using a transformer decoder. By sampling from this transformer decoder, they can produce extremely large high-quality images. Inverting GANs: One way to edit real images is to project them to the latent space, manip- ulate the latent variable, and then re-project them to image space. This process is known as resynthesis. Unfortunately, GANs only map from the latent variable to the observed data, not vice versa. This has led to methods to invert GANs (i.e., find the latent variable that corre- sponds as closely as possible to an observed image). These methods fall into two classes. The first learns a network that maps in the opposite direction (Donahue et al., 2018b; Luo et al., 2017a; Perarnau et al., 2016; Dumoulin et al., 2017; Guan et al., 2020). This is known as an encoder. The second approach is to start with some latent variable z and optimize it until it reconstructs the image as closely as possible (Creswell & Bharath, 2018; Karras et al., 2020b; Abdal et al., 2019; Lipton & Tripathi, 2017). Zhu et al. (2020a) combine both approaches. There has been particular interest in inversion for StyleGAN because it produces excellent results and can control the image at different scales. Unfortunately, Abdal et al. (2020) showed that it is not possible to invert StyleGAN without artifacts and proposed inverting to an extended style space, and Richardson et al. (2021) trained an encoder that reliably maps to this space. Even after inverting to the extended space, editing images that are out of domain may still not work well. Roich et al. (2022) address this issue by fine-tuning the generator of StyleGAN so that it reconstructs the image exactly and show that the result can be edited well. They also add extra terms that reconstruct nearby points exactly so that the modification is local. This technique is known as pivotal tuning. A survey of GAN inversion techniques can be found in Xia et al. (2022). Editing images with GANs: The iGAN (Zhu et al., 2016) allows users to make interactive edits by scribbling or warping parts of an existing image. The tool then adjusts the output Draft: please send errata to udlbookmail@gmail.com. 302 15 Generative Adversarial Networks image to be both realistic and to fit these new constraints. It does this by finding a latent vector that produces an image that is similar to the edited image and obeys the edge map of any added lines. It is typical also to add a mask so that only parts of the image close to the edits are changed. EditGAN (Ling et al., 2021) jointly models images and their semantic segmentation masks and allows edits to that mask. Problems Problem 15.1 What will the loss be in equation 15.8 when q(x) = Pr(x)?

Chapter 16 Normalizing flows Chapter 15 introduced generative adversarial networks (GANs). These are generative models that pass a latent variable through a deep network to create a new sample. GANs are trained using the principle that the samples should be indistinguishable from real data. However, they don’t define a distribution over data examples. Hence, assessing the probability that a new example belongs to the same dataset isn’t straightforward. In this chapter, we describe normalizing flows. These learn a probability model by transforming a simple distribution into a more complicated one using a deep network. Normalizing flows can both sample from this distribution and evaluate the probability of new examples. However, they require specialized architecture: each layer must be invertible. In other words, it must be able to transform data in both directions. 16.1 1D example Normalizing flows are probabilistic generative models: they fit a probability distribution to training data (figure 14.2b). Consider modeling a 1D distribution Pr(x). Normalizing flows start with a simple tractable base distribution Pr(z) over a latent variable z and apply a function x = f[z, ϕ], where the parameters ϕ are chosen so that Pr(x) has the desired distribution (figure 16.1). Generating a new example x∗is easy; we draw z∗from the base density and pass this through the function so that x∗= f[z∗, ϕ].\n",

It is easiest under- stood in the normalizing direction. GLOW starts with a 256 × 256 × 3 tensor containing an RGB image. It uses coupling layers, in which the channels are partitioned into two halves. The second half is subject to a different aﬀine transform at each spatial position, where the parameters of the aﬀine transformation are computed by a 2D convolutional neural network run on the other half of the channels. The coupling layers are alternated with 1 × 1 convolutions, parameterized as LU decompositions which mix the channels. Periodically, the resolution is halved by combining each 2 × 2 patch into one position with four times as many channels. GLOW is a multi-scale flow, and some of the channels are periodically removed to become part of the latent vector z. Images are discrete (due to the quantization of RGB values), so noise is added to the inputs to prevent the training likelihood increasing without bound. This is known as dequantization. To sample more realistic images, the GLOW model samples from the base density raised to a positive power. This chooses examples that are closer to the center of the density rather than from the tails.

It is unknown whether this is due to a fundamental restriction associated with invertible layers or merely because less research effort has been invested in this goal. Figure 16.13 shows an example of interpolation using GLOW. Two latent vectors are computed by transforming two real images in the normalizing direction. Intermediate points between these latent vectors are computed by linear interpolation, and these are projected back to image space using the network in the generative direction. The result is a set of images that interpolate realistically between the two real ones.\n",

In this context, we denote the normalizing flow Pr(x|ϕ) as the student and the target density q(x) as the teacher. To make progress, we generate samples xi = f[zi, ϕ] from the student. Since we generated these samples ourselves, we know their corresponding latent variables zi, and we can calculate their likelihood in the student model without inversion. Thus, we can use a model like a masked-autoregressive flow where inversion is slow. We define a loss function based on the reverse KL divergence that encourages the student and teacher likelihood to be identical and use this to train the student model (figure 16.14): Problem 16.11 ˆ ϕ = argmin ϕ \" KL \" I X i=1 δ \u0002 x −f[zi, ϕ] \u0003\f \f \f \f \f \f \f \fq(x) ## . (16.25) This approach contrasts with the typical use of normalizing flows to build a proba- bility model Pr(xi, ϕ) of data that came from an unknown distribution with samples xi using maximum likelihood, which relies on the cross-entropy term from the forward KL divergence (section 5.7): ˆ ϕ = argmin ϕ \" KL \" 1 I I X i=1 δ[x −xi] \f \f \f \f \f \f \f \fPr(xi, ϕ) ## . (16.26) Normalizing flows can model the posterior in VAEs using this trick (see chapter 17).\n",

This chapter reviewed invertible network layers or flows. We considered linear flows and elementwise flows, which are simple but insuﬀiciently expressive. Then we described more complex flows, such as coupling, autoregressive, and residual flows. Finally, we showed how normalizing flows can be used to estimate likelihoods, generate and inter- polate between images, and approximate other distributions. Notes Normalizing flows were first introduced by Rezende & Mohamed (2015) but had intellectual antecedents in the work of Tabak & Vanden-Eijnden (2010), Tabak & Turner (2013), and Rippel & Adams (2013). Reviews of normalizing flows can be found in Kobyzev et al. (2020) and Papamakarios et al. (2021). Kobyzev et al. (2020) presented a quantitative comparison of Draft: please send errata to udlbookmail@gmail.com. 322 16 Normalizing flows many normalizing flow approaches. They concluded that the Flow++ model (a coupling flow with a novel elementwise transformation and other innovations) performed best at the time. Invertible network layers: Invertible layers decrease the memory requirements of the back- propagation algorithm; the activations in the forward pass no longer need to be stored since they can be recomputed in the backward pass. In addition to the regular network layers and residual layers (Gomez et al., 2017; Jacobsen et al., 2018) discussed in this chapter, invertible layers have been developed for graph neural networks (Li et al., 2021a), recurrent neural net- works (MacKay et al., 2018), masked convolutions (Song et al., 2019), U-Nets (Brügger et al., 2019; Etmann et al., 2020), and transformers (Mangalam et al., 2022). Radial and planar flows: The original normalizing flows paper (Rezende & Mohamed, 2015) used planar flows (which contract or expand the distribution along certain dimensions) and radial flows (which expand or contract around a certain point). Inverses for these flows can’t be computed easily, but they are useful for approximating distributions where sampling is slow or where the likelihood can only be evaluated up to an unknown scaling factor (figure 16.14). Applications: Applications include image generation (Ho et al., 2019; Kingma & Dhariwal, 2018), noise modeling (Abdelhamed et al., 2019), video generation (Kumar et al., 2019b), au- dio generation (Esling et al., 2019; Kim et al., 2018; Prenger et al., 2019), graph generation (Madhawa et al., 2019), image classification (Kim et al., 2021; Mackowiak et al., 2021), im- age steganography (Lu et al., 2021), super-resolution (Yu et al., 2020; Wolf et al., 2021; Liang et al., 2021), style transfer (An et al., 2021), motion style transfer (Wen et al., 2021), 3D shape modeling (Paschalidou et al., 2021), compression (Zhang et al., 2021b), sRGB to RAW image conversion (Xing et al., 2021), denoising (Liu et al., 2021b), anomaly detection (Yu et al., 2021), image-to-image translation (Ardizzone et al., 2020), synthesizing cell microscopy images under different molecular interventions (Yang et al., 2021), and light transport simulation (Müller et al., 2019b). For applications using image data, noise must be added before learning since the inputs are quantized and hence discrete (see Theis et al., 2016). Rezende & Mohamed (2015) used normalizing flows to model the posterior in VAEs. Abdal et al. (2021) used normalizing flows to model the distribution of attributes in the latent space of StyleGAN and then used these distributions to change specified attributes in real images. Wolf et al. (2021) use normalizing flows to learn the conditional image of a noisy input image given a clean one and hence simulate noisy data that can be used to train denoising or super-resolution models. Normalizing flows have also found diverse uses in physics (Kanwar et al., 2020; Köhler et al., 2020; Noé et al., 2019; Wirnsberger et al., 2020; Wong et al., 2020), natural language processing (Tran et al., 2019; Ziegler & Rush, 2019; Zhou et al., 2019; He et al., 2018; Jin et al., 2019), and reinforcement learning (Schroecker et al., 2019; Haarnoja et al., 2018a; Mazoure et al., 2020; Ward et al., 2019; Touati et al., 2020). Linear flows: Diagonal linear flows can represent normalization transformations like Batch- Norm (Dinh et al., 2016) and ActNorm (Kingma & Dhariwal, 2018). Tomczak & Welling (2016) investigated combining triangular matrices and using orthogonal transformations parameterized by the Householder transform. Kingma & Dhariwal (2018) proposed the LU parameterization described in section 16.5.2. Hoogeboom et al. (2019b) proposed using the QR decomposition instead, which does not require predetermined permutation matrices. Convolutions are lin- ear transformations (figure 10.4) that are widely used in deep learning, but their inverse and determinant are not straightforward to compute. Kingma & Dhariwal (2018) used 1×1 con- volutions, which is effectively a full linear transformation applied separately at each position. Zheng et al. (2017) introduced ConvFlow, which was restricted to 1D convolutions. Hoogeboom et al. (2019b) provided more general solutions for modeling 2D convolutions either by stacking together masked autoregressive convolutions or by operating in the Fourier domain.

Notes 323 Elementwise flows and coupling functions: Elementwise flows transform each variable independently using the same function (but with different parameters for each variable). The same flows can be used to form the coupling functions in coupling and autoregressive flows, in which case their parameters depend on the preceding variables. To be invertible, these functions must be monotone. An additive coupling function (Dinh et al., 2015) just adds an offset to the variable. Aﬀine coupling functions scale the variable and add an offset and were used by Dinh et al. (2015), Dinh et al. (2016), Kingma & Dhariwal (2018), Kingma et al. (2016), and Papamakarios et al. (2017). Ziegler & Rush (2019) propose the nonlinear squared flow, which is an invertible ratio of polynomials with five parameters. Continuous mixture CDFs (Ho et al., 2019) apply a monotone transformation based on the cumulative density function (CDF) of a mixture of K logistics, post-composed by an inverse logistic sigmoid, scaled, and offset. The piecewise linear coupling function (figure 16.5) was developed by Müller et al. (2019b). Since then, systems based on cubic splines (Durkan et al., 2019a) and rational quadratic splines (Durkan et al., 2019b) have been proposed. Huang et al. (2018a) introduced neural autoregres- sive flows, in which the function is represented by a neural network that produces a monotonic function. A suﬀicient condition is that the weights are all positive and the activation functions are monotone. It is hard to train a network with the constraint that the weights are positive, so this led to unconstrained monotone neural networks (Wehenkel & Louppe, 2019), which model strictly positive functions and then integrate them numerically to get a monotone function. Jaini et al. (2019) construct positive functions that can be integrated in closed form based on a classic result that all positive single-variable polynomials are the sum of squares of polynomials. Finally, Dinh et al. (2019) investigated piecewise monotonic coupling functions. Coupling flows: Dinh et al. (2015) introduced coupling flows in which the dimensions were split in half (figure 16.6). Dinh et al. (2016) introduced RealNVP, which partitioned the image input by taking alternating pixels or blocks of channels. Das et al. (2019) proposed selecting features for the propagated part based on the magnitude of the derivatives. Dinh et al. (2016) interpreted multi-scale flows (in which dimensions are gradually introduced) as coupling flows in which the parameters ϕ have no dependence on the other half of the data. Kruse et al. (2021) introduce a hierarchical formulation of coupling flows in which each partition is recursively divided into two. GLOW (figures 16.12–16.13) was designed by Kingma & Dhariwal (2018) and uses coupling flows, as do NICE (Dinh et al., 2015), RealNVP (Dinh et al., 2016), FloWaveNet (Kim et al., 2018), WaveGlOW (Prenger et al., 2019), and Flow++ (Ho et al., 2019). Autoregressive flows: Kingma et al. (2016) used autoregressive models for normalizing flows. Germain et al. (2015) developed a general method for masking previous variables. This was exploited by Papamakarios et al. (2017) to compute all of the outputs in the forward direction simultaneously in masked autoregressive flows. Kingma et al. (2016) introduced the inverse autoregressive flow. Parallel WaveNet (Van den Oord et al., 2018) distilled WaveNet (Van den Oord et al., 2016a), which is a different type of generative model for audio, into an inverse autoregressive flow so that sampling would be fast (see figure 16.14c–d). Residual flows: Residual flows are based on residual networks (He et al., 2016a). RevNets (Gomez et al., 2017) and iRevNets (Jacobsen et al., 2018) divide the input into two sections (figure 16.8), each of which passes through a residual network. These networks are invertible, but the determinant of the Jacobian cannot be computed easily. The residual connection can be interpreted as the discretization of an ordinary differential equation, and this perspective led to different invertible architectures (Chang et al., 2018, 2019a). However, the Jacobian of these networks could still not be computed eﬀiciently. Behrmann et al. (2019) noted that the network can be inverted using fixed point iterations if its Lipschitz constant is less than one. This led to iResNet, in which the log determinant of the Jacobian can be estimated using Hutchinson’s trace Draft: please send errata to udlbookmail@gmail.com. 324 16 Normalizing flows estimator (Hutchinson, 1989). Chen et al. (2019) removed the bias induced by the truncation of the power series in equation 16.22 by using the Russian Roulette estimator. Infinitesimal flows: If residual networks can be viewed as a discretization of an ordinary differential equation (ODE), then the next logical step is to represent the change in the variables directly by an ODE. The neural ODE was explored by Chen et al. (2018e) and exploits standard methods for forward and backward propagation in ODEs. The Jacobian is no longer required to compute the likelihood; this is represented by a different ODE in which the change in log probability is related to the trace of the derivative of the forward propagation. Grathwohl et al. (2019) used the Hutchinson estimator to estimate the trace and simplified this further. Finlay et al. (2020) added regularization terms to the loss function that make training easier, and Dupont et al. (2019) augmented the representation to allow the neural ODE to represent a broader class of diffeomorphisms. Tzen & Raginsky (2019) and Peluchetti & Favaro (2020) replaced the ODEs with stochastic differential equations. Universality: The universality property refers to the ability of a normalizing flow to model any probability distribution arbitrarily well. Some flows (e.g., planar, elementwise) do not have this property. Autoregressive flows can be shown to have the universality property when the coupling function is a neural monotone network (Huang et al., 2018a), based on monotone polynomials (Jaini et al., 2020) or based on splines (Kobyzev et al., 2020). For dimension D, a series of D coupling flows can form an autoregressive flow. To understand why, note that the partitioning into two parts h1 and h2 means that at any given layer h2 depends only on the previous variables (figure 16.6). Hence, if we increase the size of h1 by one at every layer, we can reproduce an autoregressive flow, and the result is universal. It is not known whether coupling flows can be universal with fewer than D layers. However, they work well in practice (e.g., GLOW) without the need for this induced autoregressive structure. Other work: Active areas of research in normalizing flows include the investigation of discrete flows (Hoogeboom et al., 2019a; Tran et al., 2019), normalizing flows on non-Euclidean manifolds (Gemici et al., 2016; Wang & Wang, 2019), and equivariant flows (Köhler et al., 2020; Rezende et al., 2019) which aim to create densities that are invariant to families of transformations.

Chapter 17 Variational autoencoders Generative adversarial networks learn a mechanism for creating samples that are statis- tically indistinguishable from the training data {xi}. In contrast, like normalizing flows, variational autoencoders, or VAEs, are probabilistic generative models; they aim to learn a distribution Pr(x) over the data (see figure 14.2). After training, it is possible to draw (generate) samples from this distribution. However, the properties of the VAE mean that it is unfortunately not possible to evaluate the probability of new examples x∗exactly. It is common to talk about the VAE as if it is the model of Pr(x), but this is mislead- ing; the VAE is a neural architecture that is designed to help learn the model for Pr(x). The final model for Pr(x) contains neither the “variational” nor the “autoencoder” parts and might be better described as a nonlinear latent variable model. This chapter starts by introducing latent variable models in general and then con- siders the specific case of the nonlinear latent variable model. It will become clear that maximum likelihood learning of this model is not straightforward. Nevertheless, it is possible to define a lower bound on the likelihood, and the VAE architecture approxi- mates this bound using a Monte Carlo (sampling) method. The chapter concludes by presenting several applications of the VAE.\n",

The left-hand side of the figure corresponds to the left-hand side of this inequality and the right-hand side of the figure to the right-hand side. One way of thinking about this is to consider that we are taking a convex combination of the points in the orange distribution defined over y ∈[0, 1]. By the logic of figure 17.4, this must lie under the curve. Alternatively, we can think about the concave function as compressing the high values of y relative to the low values, so the expected value is lower when we pass y through the function first. g[E[y]] ≥E \u0002 g[y] \u0003 .

This follows because h[y] is another random variable with a new distribution. Since we never specified Pr(y), the relation remains true.

This equation shows that the ELBO is the original log-likelihood minus the KL di- vergence DKL [q(z|θ)||Pr(z|x, ϕ)]. The KL divergence measures the “distance” between distributions and can only take non-negative values. It follows the ELBO is a lower bound on log[Pr(x|ϕ)]. The KL distance will be zero, and the bound will be tight when q(z|θ) = Pr(z|x, ϕ).

In principle, we can compute the posterior using Bayes’ rule: Pr(z|x, ϕ) = Pr(x|z, ϕ)Pr(z) Pr(x|ϕ) , (17.19) but in practice, this is intractable because we can’t evaluate the data likelihood in the denominator (see section 17.3). One solution is to make a variational approximation: we choose a simple parametric form for q(z|θ) and use this to approximate the true posterior. Here, we choose a Appendix C.3.2 Multivariate normal multivariate normal distribution with mean µ and diagonal covariance Σ. This will not always match the posterior well but will be better for some values of µ and Σ than others. During training, we will find the normal distribution that is “closest” to the true posterior Pr(z|x) (figure 17.8). This corresponds to minimizing the KL divergence in equation 17.17 and moving the colored curves in figure 17.6 upwards. Since the optimal choice for q(z|θ) was the posterior Pr(z|x), and this depends on the data example x, the variational approximation should do the same, so we choose: q(z|x, θ) = Normz h gµ[x, θ], gΣ[x, θ] i , (17.20) where g[x, θ] is a second neural network with parameters θ that predicts the mean µ and variance Σ of the normal variational approximation.\n",

To compute the ELBO we: • compute the mean µ and variance Σ of the variational posterior distribution q(z|θ, x) for this data point x using the network g[x, θ], • draw a sample z∗from this distribution, and • compute the ELBO using equation 17.23. The associated architecture is shown in figure 17.9. It should now be clear why this is called a variational autoencoder. It is variational because it computes a Gaussian approximation to the posterior distribution. It is an autoencoder because it starts with a data point x, computes a lower-dimensional latent vector z from this, and then uses this vector to recreate the data point x as closely as possible. In this context, the mapping from the data to the latent variable by the network g[x, θ] is called the encoder, and the mapping from the latent variable to the data by the network f[z, ϕ] is called the decoder. The VAE computes the ELBO as a function of both ϕ and θ. To maximize this bound, we run mini-batches of samples through the network and update these parameters with an optimization algorithm such as SGD or Adam. The gradients of the ELBO with respect to the parameters are computed as usual using automatic differentiation. During this process, we are both moving between the colored curves (changing θ) and along them (changing ϕ) in figure 17.10.

A better approach is to use importance sampling. Here, we sample z from an auxiliary distribution q(z), evaluate Pr(x|zn), and rescale the resulting values by the probability q(z) under the new distribution: Pr(x) = Z Pr(x|z)Pr(z)dz = Z Pr(x|z)Pr(z) q(z) q(z)dz = Eq(z) hPr(x|z)Pr(z) q(z) i ≈ 1 N N X n=1 Pr(x|zn)Pr(zn) q(zn) , (17.28) where now we draw the samples from q(z).

In figure 17.13, multiple images labeled as “neutral” or “smiling” are projected into latent space. The vector representing this change is estimated by taking the difference in latent space between the means of these two groups. A second vector is estimated to represent “mouth closed” versus “mouth open.” Now the image of interest is projected into the latent space, and then the repre- sentation is modified by adding or subtracting these vectors. To generate intermediate images, spherical linear interpolation or Slerp is used rather than linear interpolation.

The process of encoding (and possibly modifying) input data before decoding again is known as resynthesis. This can also be done with GANs and normalizing flows.

Here the regularization term r1[•] is a function of the posterior and is weighted by λ1. The term r2[•] is a function of the aggregated posterior and is weighted by λ2.

Since the prior is usually a multivariate normal with a spherical covariance matrix, its dimensions are independent. Hence, up-weighting this term encourages the posterior distributions to be less correlated. Another variant is the total correlation VAE, which adds a term to decrease the total correlation between vari- ables in the latent space (figure 17.14) and maximizes the mutual information between a small subset of the latent variables and the observations.\n",

In each case, the central column depicts samples from the model, and as we move left to right, we are subtracting or adding a coordinate vector in latent space. Adapted from Chen et al. (2018d). It is not possible to compute the likelihood of a data point in closed form, and this poses problems for training with maximum likelihood. However, we can define a lower bound on the likelihood and maximize this bound. Unfortunately, for the bound to be tight, we need to compute the posterior probability of the latent variable given the observed data, which is also intractable. The solution is to make a variational approximation. This is a simpler distribution (usually a Gaussian) that approximates the posterior and whose parameters are computed by a second encoder network. To create high-quality samples from the VAE, it seems to be necessary to model the latent space with more sophisticated probability distributions than the Gaussian prior and posterior. One option is to use hierarchical priors (in which one latent variable generates another). The next chapter discusses diffusion models, which produce very high-quality examples and can be viewed as hierarchical VAEs. Notes The VAE was originally introduced by Kingma & Welling (2014). A comprehensive introduction to variational autoencoders can be found in Kingma et al. (2019). Applications: The VAE and variants thereof have been applied to images (Kingma & Welling, 2014; Gregor et al., 2016; Gulrajani et al., 2016; Akuzawa et al., 2018), speech (Hsu et al., 2017b), text (Bowman et al., 2015; Hu et al., 2017; Xu et al., 2020), molecules (Gómez-Bombarelli et al., Draft: please send errata to udlbookmail@gmail.com. 344 17 Variational autoencoders 2018; Sultan et al., 2018), graphs (Kipf & Welling, 2016; Simonovsky & Komodakis, 2018), robotics (Hernández et al., 2018; Inoue et al., 2018; Park et al., 2018), reinforcement learning (Heess et al., 2015; Van Hoof et al., 2016), 3D scenes (Eslami et al., 2016, 2018; Rezende Jimenez et al., 2016), and handwriting (Chung et al., 2015). Applications include resynthesis and interpolation (White, 2016; Bowman et al., 2015), collab- orative filtering (Liang et al., 2018), and compression (Gregor et al., 2016). Gómez-Bombarelli et al. (2018) use the VAE to construct a continuous representation of chemical structures that can then be optimized for desirable properties. Ravanbakhsh et al. (2017) simulate astronomical observations for calibrating measurements. Relation to other models: The autoencoder (Rumelhart et al., 1985; Hinton & Salakhutdi- nov, 2006) passes data through an encoder to a bottleneck layer and then reconstructs it using a decoder. The bottleneck is similar to latent variables in the VAE, but the motivation differs. Here, the goal is not to learn a probability distribution but to create a low-dimensional repre- sentation that captures the essence of the data. Autoencoders also have various applications, including denoising (Vincent et al., 2008) and anomaly detection (Zong et al., 2018). If the encoder and decoder are linear transformations, the autoencoder is just principal compo- nent analysis (PCA). Hence, the nonlinear autoencoder is a generalization of PCA. There are also probabilistic forms of PCA. Probabilistic PCA (Tipping & Bishop, 1999) adds spherical Gaussian noise to the reconstruction to create a probability model, and factor analysis adds diagonal Gaussian noise (see Rubin & Thayer, 1982). If we make the encoder and decoder of these probabilistic variants nonlinear, we return to the variational autoencoder. Architectural variations: The conditional VAE (Sohn et al., 2015) passes class information c into both the encoder and decoder. The result is that the latent space does not need to encode the class information. For example, when MNIST data are conditioned on the digit label, the latent variables might encode the orientation and width of the digit rather than the digit category itself. Sønderby et al. (2016a) introduced ladder variational autoencoders, which recursively correct the generative distribution with a data-dependent approximate likelihood term. Modifying likelihood: Other work investigates more sophisticated likelihood models Pr(x|z). The PixelVAE (Gulrajani et al., 2016) used an autoregressive model over the output variables. Dorta et al. (2018) modeled the covariance of the decoder output as well as the mean. Lamb et al. (2016) improved the quality of reconstruction by adding extra regularization terms that encourage the reconstruction to be similar to the original image in the space of activations of a layer of an image classification model. This model encourages semantic information to be retained and was used to generate the results in figure 17.13. Larsen et al. (2016) use an adversarial loss for reconstruction, which also improves results. Latent space, prior, and posterior: Many different forms for the variational approximation to the posterior have been investigated, including normalizing flows (Rezende & Mohamed, 2015; Kingma et al., 2016), directed graphical models (Maaløe et al., 2016), undirected models (Vahdat et al., 2020), and recursive models for temporal data (Gregor et al., 2016, 2019). Other authors have investigated using a discrete latent space (Van Den Oord et al., 2017; Razavi et al., 2019b; Rolfe, 2017; Vahdat et al., 2018a,b) For example, Razavi et al. (2019b) use a vector quantized latent space and model the prior with an autoregressive model (equation 12.15). This is slow to sample from but can describe very complex distributions. This work is subject to a Creative Commons CC-BY-NC-ND license. (C) MIT Press. Notes 345 Jiang et al. (2016) use a mixture of Gaussians for the posterior, allowing clustering. This is a hierarchical latent variable model that adds a discrete latent variable to improve the flexibility of the posterior. Other authors (Salimans et al., 2015; Ranganath et al., 2016; Maaløe et al., 2016; Vahdat & Kautz, 2020) have experimented with hierarchical models that use continuous variables. These have a close connection with diffusion models (chapter 18). Combination with other models: Gulrajani et al. (2016) combined VAEs with an autore- gressive model to produce more realistic images. Chung et al. (2015) combine the VAE with recurrent neural networks to model time-varying measurements. As discussed above, adversarial losses have been used to inform the likelihood term directly. However, other models have combined ideas from generative adversarial networks (GANs) with VAEs in different ways. Makhzani et al. (2015) use an adversarial loss in the latent space; the idea is that the discriminator will ensure that the aggregated posterior distribution q(z) is indistinguishable from the prior distribution Pr(z). Tolstikhin et al. (2018) generalize this to a broader family of distances between the prior and aggregated posterior. Dumoulin et al. (2017) introduced adversarially learned inference which uses an adversarial loss to distinguish two pairs of latent/observed data points. In one case, the latent variable is drawn from the latent posterior distribution and, in the other, from the prior. Other hybrids of VAEs and GANs were proposed by Larsen et al. (2016), Brock et al. (2016), and Hsu et al. (2017a). Posterior collapse: One potential problem in training is posterior collapse, in which the encoder always predicts the prior distribution. This was identified by Bowman et al. (2015) and can be mitigated by gradually increasing the term that encourages the KL distance between the posterior and the prior to be small during training. Several other methods have been proposed to prevent posterior collapse (Razavi et al., 2019a; Lucas et al., 2019b,a), and this is also part of the motivation for using a discrete latent space (Van Den Oord et al., 2017). Blurry reconstructions: Zhao et al. (2017c) provide evidence that the blurry reconstructions are partly due to Gaussian noise and also because of the sub-optimal posterior distributions induced by the variational approximation. It is perhaps not coincidental that some of the best synthesis results have come from using a discrete latent space modeled by a sophisticated autoregressive model (Razavi et al., 2019b) or from using hierarchical latent spaces (Vahdat & Kautz, 2020; see figure 17.12d). Figure 17.12a-c used a VAE that was trained on the CELEBA database (Liu et al., 2015). Figure 17.12d uses a hierarchical VAE that was trained on the CELEBA HQ dataset (Karras et al., 2018). Other problems: Chen et al. (2017) noted that when more complex likelihood terms are used, such as the PixelCNN (Van den Oord et al., 2016c), the output can cease to depend on the latent variables at all. They term this the information preference problem. This was addressed by Zhao et al. (2017b) in the InfoVAE, which added an extra term that maximized the mutual information between the latent and observed distributions. Another problem with the VAE is that there can be “holes” in the latent space that do not correspond to any realistic sample. Xu et al. (2020) introduce the constrained posterior VAE, which helps prevent these vacant regions in latent space by adding a regularization term. This allows for better interpolation from real samples. Disentangling latent representation: Methods to “disentangle” the latent representation include the beta VAE (Higgins et al., 2017) and others (e.g., Kim & Mnih, 2018; Kumar et al., Draft: please send errata to udlbookmail@gmail.com. 346 17 Variational autoencoders Figure 17.15 Expectation maximization (EM) algorithm. The EM algorithm al- ternately adjusts the auxiliary parame- ters θ (moves between colored curves) and model parameters ϕ (moves along colored curves) until the a maximum is reached. These adjustments are known as the E-step and the M-step, respectively. Because the E-Step uses the posterior distribution Pr(h|x, ϕ) for q(h|x, θ), the bound is tight, and the colored curve touches the black like- lihood curve after each E-Step. 2018). Chen et al. (2018d) further decomposed the ELBO to show the existence of a term measuring the total correlation between the latent variables (i.e., the distance between the aggregate posterior and the product of its marginals). They use this to motivate the total correlation VAE, which attempts to minimize this quantity. The Factor VAE (Kim & Mnih, 2018) uses a different approach to minimize the total correlation. Mathieu et al. (2019) discuss the factors that are important in disentangling representations. Reparameterization trick: Consider computing an expectation of some function, where the probability distribution with which the expectation is taken depends on some parameters. The reparameterization trick computes the derivative of this expectation with respect to these pa- rameters. This chapter introduced this as a method to differentiate through the sampling procedure approximating the expectation; there are alternative approaches (see problem 17.5), but the reparameterization trick gives an estimator that (usually) has low variance. This issue is discussed in Rezende et al. (2014), Kingma et al. (2015), and Roeder et al. (2017). Lower bound and the EM algorithm: VAE training is based on optimizing the evidence lower bound (sometimes also referred to as the ELBO, variational lower bound, or negative variational free energy). Hoffman & Johnson (2016) and Lücke et al. (2020) re-express this lower bound in several ways that elucidate its properties. Other work has aimed to make this bound tighter (Burda et al., 2016; Li & Turner, 2016; Bornschein et al., 2016; Masrani et al., 2019). For example, Burda et al. (2016) use a modified bound based on using multiple importance-weighted samples from the approximate posterior to form the objective function. The ELBO is tight when the distribution q(z|θ) matches the posterior Pr(z|x, ϕ). This is the basis of the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm (Dempster et al., 1977). Here, we alternately (i) choose θ so that q(z|θ) equals the posterior Pr(z|x, ϕ) and (ii) change ϕ to Problem 17.7 maximize the lower bound (figure 17.15). This is viable for models like the mixture of Gaussians, where we can compute the posterior distribution in closed form. Unfortunately, this is not the case for the nonlinear latent variable model, so this method cannot be used.

Chapter 18 Diffusion models Chapter 15 described generative adversarial models, which produce plausible-looking samples but do not define a probability distribution over the data. Chapter 16 discussed normalizing flows. These do define such a probability distribution but must place archi- tectural constraints on the network; each layer must be invertible, and the determinant of its Jacobian must be easy to calculate. Chapter 17 introduced variational autoen- coders, which also have a solid probabilistic foundation but where the computation of the likelihood is intractable and must be approximated by a lower bound. This chapter introduces diffusion models. Like normalizing flows, these are proba- bilistic models that define a nonlinear mapping from latent variables to the observed data where both quantities have the same dimension. Like variational autoencoders, they ap- proximate the data likelihood using a lower bound based on an encoder that maps to the latent variable. However, in diffusion models, this encoder is predetermined; the goal is to learn a decoder that is the inverse of this process and can be used to produce samples. Diffusion models are easy to train and can produce very high-quality samples that exceed the realism of those produced by GANs. The reader should be familiar with variational autoencoders (chapter 17) before reading this chapter.\n",

The loss function encourages each network to invert the corresponding encoder step. The result is that noise is gradually removed from the representation until a realistic-looking data example remains. To generate a new data example x, we draw a sample from q(zT ) and pass it through the decoder. In section 18.2, we consider the encoder in detail. Its properties are non-obvious but are critical for the learning algorithm. In section 18.3, we discuss the decoder. Section 18.4 derives the training algorithm, and section 18.5 reformulates it to be more practical.

However, generating these sequentially using equation 18.1 is time- consuming when t is large. Fortunately, there is a closed-form expression for q(zt|x), which allows us to directly draw samples zt given initial data point x without computing the intermediate variables z1 . . . zt−1. This is known as the diffusion kernel (figure 18.3). To derive an expression for q(zt|x), consider the first two steps of the forward process: z1 = p 1 −β1 · x + p β1 · ϵ1 z2 = p 1 −β2 · z1 + p β2 · ϵ2. (18.4) Substituting the first equation into the second, we get: z2 = p 1 −β2 \u0010p 1 −β1 · x + p β1 · ϵ1 \u0011 + p β2 · ϵ2 (18.5) = p 1 −β2 \u0010p 1 −β1 · x + p 1 −(1 −β1) · ϵ1 \u0011 + p β2 · ϵ2 = p (1 −β2)(1 −β1) · x + p 1 −β2 −(1 −β2)(1 −β1) · ϵ1 + p β2 · ϵ2. The last two terms are independent samples from mean-zero normal distributions with variances 1 −β2 −(1 −β2)(1 −β1) and β2, respectively. The mean of this sum is zero, Problem 18.2 and its variance is the sum of the component variances (see problem 18.2), so: z2 = p (1 −β2)(1 −β1) · x + p 1 −(1 −β2)(1 −β1) · ϵ, (18.6) where ϵ is also a sample from a standard normal distribution. If we continue this process by substituting this equation into the expression for z3 and so on, we can show that: Problem 18.3 zt = √αt · x + √ 1 −αt · ϵ, (18.7) where αt = Qt s=1 1 −βs. We can equivalently write this in probabilistic form: q(zt|x) = Normzt h√αt · x, (1 −αt)I i . (18.8) For any starting data point x, variable zt is normally distributed with a known mean and variance. Consequently, if we don’t care about the history of the evolution through the intermediate variables z1 . . . zt−1, it is easy to generate samples from q(zt|x).\n",

However, there may be a very large number of diffusion steps, and training and storing multiple U-Nets is ineﬀicient. The solution is to train a single U-Net that also takes a predetermined vector representing the time step as input (figure 18.9). In practice, this is resized to match the number of channels at each stage of the U-Net and used to offset and/or scale the representation at each spatial position. A large number of time steps are needed as the conditional probabilities q(zt−1|zt) become closer to normal when the hyperparameters βt are close to zero, matching the form of the decoder distributions Pr(zt−1|zt, ϕt).

Like the U-Net, it is usually shared across all time steps and takes time as an input. The update from zt to zt−1 now makes the class c more likely. Classifier-free guidance avoids learning a separate classifier Pr(c|zt) but instead in- corporates class information into the main model gt[zt, ϕt, c].

Second, it’s possible to modify the noise schedule in the forward process so that βt varies at each step, and this can also improve results. Third, to generate high-resolution images, a cascade of diffusion models is used. The first creates a low-resolution image (possibly guided by class information). The subse- quent diffusion models generate progressively higher-resolution images. They condition on the lower-resolution image by resizing this and appending it to the layers of the constituent U-Net, as well as any other class information (figure 18.11). Combining all of these techniques allows the generation of very high-quality images. Figure 18.12 shows examples of images generated from a model conditioned on the Ima- geNet class. It is particularly impressive that the same model can learn to generate such diverse classes. Figure 18.13 shows images generated from a model that is trained to condition on text captions encoded by a language model like BERT, which are inserted into the model in the same way as the time step (figures 18.9 and 18.11).

(2022). Surveys of denoising diffusion models can be found in Croitoru et al. (2022), Cao et al. (2022), Luo (2022), and Yang et al. (2022). Applications for images: Applications of diffusion models include text-to-image generation (Nichol et al., 2022; Ramesh et al., 2022; Saharia et al., 2022b), image-to-image tasks such as colorization, inpainting, uncropping and restoration (Saharia et al., 2022a), super-resolution (Saharia et al., 2022c), image editing (Hertz et al., 2022; Meng et al., 2021), removing adversarial perturbations (Nie et al., 2022), semantic segmentation (Baranchuk et al., 2022), and medical imaging (Song et al., 2021b; Chung & Ye, 2022; Chung et al., 2022; Peng et al., 2022; Xie & Li, 2022; Luo et al., 2022) where the diffusion model is sometimes used as a prior. Different data types: Diffusion models have also been applied to video data (Ho et al., 2022b; Harvey et al., 2022; Yang et al., 2022; Höppe et al., 2022; Voleti et al., 2022) for generation, past and future frame prediction, and interpolation. They have been used for 3D shape generation (Zhou et al., 2021; Luo & Hu, 2021), and recently a technique has been introduced to generate 3D models using only a 2D text-to-image diffusion model (Poole et al., 2023). Austin et al. (2021) and Hoogeboom et al. (2021) investigated diffusion models for discrete data. Kong et al. (2021) and Chen et al. (2021d) applied diffusion models to audio data. Alternatives to denoising: The diffusion models in this chapter mix noise with the data and build a model to gradually denoise the result. However, degrading the image using noise is not necessary. Rissanen et al. (2022) devised a method that progressively blurred the image and Bansal et al. (2022) showed that the same ideas work with a large family of degradations that do not have to be stochastic. These include masking, morphing, blurring, and pixelating. Comparison to other generative models: Diffusion models synthesize higher quality im- ages than other generative models and are simple to train. They can be thought of as a special case of a hierarchical VAE (Vahdat & Kautz, 2020; Sønderby et al., 2016b) where the encoder is fixed, and the latent space is the same size as the data. They are probabilistic, but in their basic form, they can only compute a lower bound on the likelihood of a data point. However, Kingma et al. (2021) show that this lower bound improves on the exact log-likelihoods for test data from normalizing flows and autoregressive models. The likelihood for diffusion models can be computed by converting to an ordinary differential equation (Song et al., 2021c) or by training a continuous normalizing flow model with a diffusion-based criterion (Lipman et al., 2022). The main disadvantages of diffusion models are that they are slow and that the latent space has no semantic interpretation. Improving quality: Many techniques have been proposed to improve image quality. These include the reparameterization of the network described in section 18.5 and the equal weighting of the subsequent terms (Ho et al., 2020). Choi et al. (2022) subsequently investigated different weightings of terms in the loss function. Kingma et al. (2021) improved the test log-likelihood of the model by learning the denoising weights βt. Conversely, Nichol & Dhariwal (2021) improved performance by learning separate variances σ2 of the denoising estimate at each time step in addition to the mean. Bao et al. (2022) show how to learn the variances after training the model. Ho et al. (2022a) developed the cascaded method for producing very high-resolution images (figure 18.11). To prevent artifacts in lower-resolution images from being propagated to higher resolutions, they introduced noise conditioning augmentation; here, the lower-resolution condi- tioning image is degraded by adding noise at each training step. This reduces the reliance on the exact details of the lower-resolution image during training. It is also done during inference, where the best noise level is chosen by sweeping over different values. Draft: please send errata to udlbookmail@gmail.com. 370 18 Diffusion models Improving speed: One of the major drawbacks of diffusion models is that they take a long time to train and sample from. Stable diffusion (Rombach et al., 2022) projects the original data to a smaller latent space using a conventional autoencoder and then runs the diffusion process in this smaller space. This has the advantages of reducing the dimensionality of the training data for the diffusion process and allowing other data types (text, graphs, etc.) to be described by diffusion models. Vahdat et al. (2021) applied a similar approach. Song et al. (2021a) showed that an entire family of diffusion processes is compatible with the training objective. Most of these processes are non-Markovian (i.e., the diffusion step does not only depend on the results of the previous step). One of these models is the denoising diffusion implicit model (DDIM), in which the updates are not stochastic (figure 18.10b). This model is amenable to taking larger steps (figure 18.10b) without inducing large errors. It effectively converts the model into an ordinary differential equation (ODE) in which the trajectories have low curvature and allows eﬀicient numerical methods for solving ODEs to be applied. Song et al. (2021c) propose converting the underlying stochastic differential equations into a probability flow ODE which has the same marginal distributions as the original process. Vahdat et al. (2021), Xiao et al. (2022b), and Karras et al. (2022) all exploit techniques for solving ODEs to speed up synthesis. Karras et al. (2022) identified the best-performing time discretization for sampling and evaluated different sampler schedules. The result of these and other improvements has been a significant drop in steps required during synthesis. Sampling is slow because many small diffusion steps are required to ensure that the posterior distribution q(zt−1|zt) is close to Gaussian (figure 18.5), so the Gaussian distribution in the decoder is appropriate. If we use a model that describes a more complex distribution at each denoising step, then we can use fewer diffusion steps in the first place. To this end, Xiao et al. (2022b) have investigated using conditional GAN models, and Gao et al. (2021) investigated using conditional energy-based models. Although these models cannot describe the original data distribution, they suﬀice to predict the (much simpler) reverse diffusion step. Salimans & Ho (2022) distilled adjacent steps of the denoising process into a single step to speed up synthesis. Dockhorn et al. (2022) introduced momentum into the diffusion process. This makes the trajectories smoother and so more amenable to coarse sampling. Conditional generation: Dhariwal & Nichol (2021) introduced classifier guidance, in which a classifier learns to identify the category of object being synthesized at each step, and this is used to bias the denoising update toward that class. This works well, but training a separate classifier is expensive. Classifier-free guidance (Ho & Salimans, 2022) concurrently trains conditional and unconditional denoising models by dropping the class information some proportion of the time in a process akin to dropout. This technique allows control of the relative contributions of the conditional and unconditional components. Over-weighting the conditional component causes the model to produce more typical and realistic samples. The standard technique for conditioning on images is to append the (resized) image to the different layers of the U-Net. For example, this was used in the cascaded generation process for super-resolution (Ho et al., 2022a). Choi et al. (2021) provide a method for conditioning on images in an unconditional diffusion model by matching the latent variables with those of a conditioning image. The standard technique for conditioning on text is to linearly transform the text embedding to the same size as the U-Net layer and then add it to the representation in the same way that the time embedding is introduced (figure 18.9). Existing diffusion models can also be fine-tuned to be conditioned on edge maps, joint positions, segmentation, depth maps, etc., using a neural network structure called a control network (Zhang & Agrawala, 2023). Text-to-image: Before diffusion models, state-of-the-art text-to-image systems were based on transformers (e.g., Ramesh et al., 2021). GLIDE (Nichol et al., 2022) and Dall·E 2 (Ramesh et al., 2022) are both conditioned on embeddings from the CLIP model (Radford et al., 2021), This work is subject to a Creative Commons CC-BY-NC-ND license. (C) MIT Press. Notes 371 which generates joint embeddings for text and image data. Imagen (Saharia et al., 2022b) showed that text embeddings from a large language model could produce even better results (see figure 18.13). The same authors introduced a benchmark (DrawBench) which is designed to evaluate the ability of a model to render colors, numbers of objects, spatial relations, and other characteristics. Feng et al. (2022) developed a Chinese text-to-image model. Connections to other models: This chapter described diffusion models as hierarchical vari- ational autoencoders because this approach connects most closely with the other parts of this book. However, diffusion models also have close connections with stochastic differential equa- tions (consider the paths in figure 18.5) and with score matching (Song & Ermon, 2019, 2020). Song et al. (2021c) presented a framework based on stochastic differential equations that en- compasses both the denoising and score matching interpretations. Diffusion models also have close connections to normalizing flows (Zhang & Chen, 2021). Yang et al. (2022) present an overview of the relationship between diffusion models and other generative approaches. Problems Problem 18.1 Show that if Var[xt−1] = I and we use the update: xt = p 1 −βt · xt−1 + p βt · ϵt, (18.41) then Var[xt] = I, so the variance stays the same.

Chapter 19 Reinforcement learning Reinforcement learning (RL) is a sequential decision-making framework in which agents learn to perform actions in an environment with the goal of maximizing received rewards. For example, an RL algorithm might control the moves (actions) of a character (the agent) in a video game (the environment), aiming to maximize the score (the reward). In robotics, an RL algorithm might control the movements (actions) of a robot (the agent) in the world (the environment) to perform a task (earning a reward). In finance, an RL algorithm might control a virtual trader (the agent) who buys or sells assets (the actions) on a trading platform (the environment) to maximize profit (the reward). Consider learning to play chess. Here, there is a reward of +1, −1, or 0 at the end of the game if the agent wins, loses, or draws and 0 at every other time step. This illustrates the challenges of RL. First, the reward is sparse; here, we must play an entire game to receive feedback. Second, the reward is temporally offset from the action that caused it; a decisive advantage might be gained thirty moves before victory. We must associate the reward with this critical action. This is termed the temporal credit assignment problem. Third, the environment is stochastic; the opponent doesn’t always make the same move in the same situation, so it’s hard to know if an action was truly good or just lucky. Finally, the agent must balance exploring the environment (e.g., trying new opening moves) with exploiting what it already knows (e.g., sticking to a previously successful opening). This is termed the exploration-exploitation trade-off. Reinforcement learning is an overarching framework that does not necessarily require deep learning. However, in practice, state-of-the-art systems often use deep networks. They encode the environment (the video game display, robot sensors, financial time series, or chessboard) and map this directly or indirectly to the next action (figure 1.13).\n",

In a POMDP, the agent does not have access to the entire state. Here, the penguin is in state three and can only see the region in the dashed box. This is indistinguishable from what it would see in state nine. In the first case, moving right leads to the hole in the ice (with -2 reward) and, in the latter, to the fish (with +3 reward).

This policy is not optimal but still generally steers the penguin from top-left to bottom-right where the reward lies. b) This policy is more random. c) A stochastic policy has a probability distribution over actions for each state (probability indicated by size of arrows). This has the advantage that the agent explores the states more thoroughly and can be necessary for optimal performance in partially observable Markov decision processes.

This policy is based on the observed action values in every state, but of course, it’s not possible to estimate the value of actions that haven’t been used, and there is nothing to encourage the algorithm to explore these. One solution is to use exploring starts. Here, episodes with all possible state-action pairs are initiated, so every combination is observed at least once. However, this is impractical if the number of states is large or the starting point cannot be controlled. A different approach is Problem 19.4 to use an epsilon greedy policy, in which a random action is taken with probability ϵ, and the optimal action is allotted the remaining probability. The choice of ϵ trades off exploitation and exploration. Here, an on-policy method will seek the best policy from this epsilon-greedy family, which will not generally be the best overall policy. Conversely, in off-policy methods, the optimal policy π (the target policy) is learned based on episodes generated by a different behavior policy π′.

Unfortunately, the full state is not observable from a single frame. For example, the velocity of game ob- jects is unknown. To help resolve this problem, the network ingests the last four frames at each time step to form st. It maps these frames through three convolutional layers followed by a fully connected layer to predict the value of every action (figure 19.14). Several modifications were made to the standard training procedure. First, the re- wards (which were driven by the score in the game) were clipped to −1 for a negative change and +1 for a positive change.

(19.27) The log probability log[Pr(τ|θ)] of a trajectory is given by: log[Pr(τ|θ)] = log h Pr(s1) T Y t=1 π[at|st, θ]Pr(st+1|st, at) i (19.28) = log \u0002 Pr(s1) \u0003 + T X t=1 log \u0002 π[at|st, θ] \u0003 + T X t=1 log \u0002 Pr(st+1|st, at) \u0003 , and noting that only the center term depends on θ, we can rewrite the update from equation 19.27 as: θ ←θ + α · 1 I I X i=1 T X t=1 ∂log \u0002 π[ait|sit, θ] \u0003 ∂θ r[τ i], (19.29) where sit is the state at time t in episode i, and ait is the action taken at time t in episode i. Note that since the terms relating to the state evolution Pr(st+1|st, at) disappear, this parameter update does not assume a Markov time evolution process. We can further simplify this by noting that: r[τ i] = T X t=1 rit = t−1 X k=1 rik + T X k=t rik, (19.30) This work is subject to a Creative Commons CC-BY-NC-ND license.

However, if the baseline co-varies with irrelevant Notebook 19.5 Control variates factors that add uncertainty, then subtracting it reduces the variance (figure 19.16). This is a special case of the method of control variates (see problem 19.7). Problem 19.7 This raises the question of how we should choose b. We can find the value of b that minimizes the variance by writing an expression for the variance, taking the derivative with respect to b, setting the result to zero, and solving to yield: Problem 19.8 b = X i PT t=1 \u0000∂log \u0002 πait[sit, θ] \u0003 /∂θ \u00012 r[τ it] PT t=1 \u0000∂log \u0002 πait[sit, θ] \u0003 /∂θ \u00012 .

The decision transformer treats offline rein- forcement learning as a sequence prediction task. The input is a sequence of states, actions, and returns-to-go (remaining rewards in the episode), each of which is mapped to a fixed-size embedding. At each time step, the network predicts the next action. During testing, the returns-to-go are unknown; in practice, an initial estimate is made from which subsequent observed rewards are subtracted. The policy network π[st, θ] that predicts Pr(a|st) is termed the actor. The value network v[st, ϕ] is termed the critic. Often the same network represents both actor and the critic, with two sets of outputs that predict the policy and the values, respectively. Note that although actor-critic methods can update the policy parameters at each step, this is rarely done in practice. The agent typically collects a batch of experience over many time steps before the policy is updated.\n",

In particular, we can treat this as a sequence learning problem, in which the goal is to predict the next action, given the history of states, rewards, and actions. The decision transformer exploits a transformer decoder framework (section 12.7) to make these predictions (figure 19.17). However, the goal is to predict actions based on future rewards, and these are not captured in a standard s, a, r sequence. Hence, the decision transformer replaces the reward rt with the returns-to-go Rt:T = PT t′=t rt (i.e., the sum of the empirically observed future rewards). The remaining framework is very similar to a standard transformer decoder. The states, actions, and returns-to-go are converted to fixed-size embeddings via learned mappings. For Atari games, the state embedding might be converted via a convolutional network similar to that in figure 19.14. The embeddings for the actions and returns-to-go can be learned in the same way as word embeddings (figure 12.9). The transformer is trained with masked self-attention and position embeddings. This formulation is natural during training but poses a quandary during inference because we don’t know the returns-to-go. This can be resolved by using the desired total return at the first step and decrementing this as rewards are received. For example, in an Atari game, the desired total return would be the total score required to win. Decision transformers can also be fine-tuned from online experience and hence learn over time. They have the advantage of dispensing with most of the reinforcement learn- ing machinery and its associated instability and replacing this with standard supervised learning. Transformers can learn from enormous quantities of data and integrate infor- mation across large time contexts (making the temporal credit assignment problem more tractable). This represents an intriguing new direction for reinforcement learning.\n",

Policy gradient methods directly optimize the policy rather than assigning values to actions. They produce stochastic policies, which are important when the environment is partially observable. The updates are noisy, and many refinements have been introduced to reduce their variance. Offline reinforcement learning is used when we cannot interact with the environment but must learn from historical data. The decision transformer leverages recent progress in deep learning to build a model of the state-action-reward sequence and predict the actions that will maximize the rewards.

(2017), François-Lavet et al. (2018), and Wang et al. (2022c) all provide overviews of deep reinforcement learning. Graesser & Keng (2019) is an excellent introductory resource that includes Python code. Landmarks in deep reinforcement learning: Most landmark achievements of reinforcement learning have been in either video games or real-world games since these provide constrained en- vironments with limited actions and fixed rules. Deep Q-Learning (Mnih et al., 2015) achieved human-level performance across a benchmark of ATARI games. AlphaGo (Silver et al., 2016) beat the world champion at Go. This game was previously considered very diﬀicult for comput- ers to play. Berner et al. (2019) built a system that beat the world champion team in the five vs. five-player game Defense of the Ancients 2, which requires cooperation across players. Ye et al. (2021) built a system that could beat humans on Atari games with limited data (in contrast to previous systems, which need much more experience than humans). More recently, the Cicero system demonstrated human-level performance in the game Diplomacy which requires natural language negotiations and coordination between players (FAIR, 2022). RL has also been applied successfully to combinatorial optimization problems (see Mazyavkina et al., 2021). For example, Kool et al. (2019) learned a model that performed similarly to the best heuristics for the traveling salesman problem. Recently, AlphaTensor (Fawzi et al., 2022) treated matrix multiplication as a game and learned faster ways to multiply matrices using fewer multiplication operations. Since deep learning relies heavily on matrix multiplication, this is one of the first examples of self-improvement in AI. Classical reinforcement learning methods: Very early contributions to the theory of MDPs were made by Thompson (1933) and Thompson (1935). The Bellman recursions were introduced by Bellman (1966). Howard (1960) introduced policy iteration. Sutton & Barto (2018) identify the work of Andreae (1969) as being the first to describe RL using the MDP formalism. The modern era of reinforcement learning arguably originated in the Ph.D. theses of Sutton (1984) and Watkins (1989). Sutton (1988) introduced the term temporal difference learning. Watkins (1989) and Watkins & Dayan (1992) introduced Q-Learning and showed that it con- verges to a fixed point by Banach’s theorem because the Bellman operator is a contraction mapping. Watkins (1989) made the first explicit connection between dynamic programming and reinforcement learning. SARSA was developed by Rummery & Niranjan (1994). Gordon (1995) introduced fitted Q-learning in which a machine learning model is used to predict the action value for each state-action pair. Riedmiller (2005) introduced neural-fitted Q-learning, which used a neural network to predict all the action values at once from a state. Early work on Monte Carlo methods was carried out by Singh & Sutton (1996), and the exploring starts algorithm was introduced by Sutton & Barto (1999). Note that this is an extremely cursory summary of more than fifty years of work. A much more thorough treatment can be found in Sutton & Barto (2018). Deep Q-Networks: Deep Q-Learning was devised by Mnih et al. (2015) and is an intellectual descendent of neural-fitted Q-learning. It exploited the then-recent successes of convolutional networks to develop a fitted Q-Learning method that could achieve human-level performance on a benchmark of ATARI games. Deep Q-Learning suffers from the deadly triad issue (Sutton & Barto, 2018): training can be unstable in any scheme that incorporates (i) bootstrapping, (ii) off-policy learning, and (iii) function approximation. Much subsequent work has aimed to make training more stable. Mnih et al. (2015) introduced the experience replay buffer (Lin, 1992), which was subsequently improved by Schaul et al. (2016) to favor more important tuples and hence increase learning speed. This is termed prioritized experience replay. This work is subject to a Creative Commons CC-BY-NC-ND license. (C) MIT Press. Notes 397 The original Q-Learning paper concatenated four frames so the network could observe the velocities of objects and make the underlying process closer to fully observable. Hausknecht & Stone (2015) introduced deep recurrent Q-learning, which used a recurrent network architecture that only ingested a single frame at a time because it could “remember” the previous states. Van Hasselt (2010) identified the systematic overestimation of the state values due to the max operation and proposed double Q-Learning in which two models are trained simultaneously to remedy this. This was subsequently applied in the context of deep Q-learning (Van Hasselt et al., 2016), although its eﬀicacy has since been questioned (Hessel et al., 2018). Wang et al. (2016) introduced deep dueling networks in which two heads of the same network predict (i) the state value and (ii) the advantage (relative value) of each action. The intuition here is that sometimes it is the state value that is important, and it doesn’t matter much which action is taken, and decoupling these estimates improves stability. Fortunato et al. (2018) introduced noisy deep Q-Networks, in which some weights in the Q- Network are multiplied by noise to add stochasticity to the predictions and encourage explo- ration. The network can learn to decrease the magnitudes of the noise over time as it converges to a sensible policy. Distributional DQN (Bellemare et al., 2017a; Dabney et al., 2018 follow- ing Morimura et al., 2010) aims to estimate more complete information about the distribution of returns than just the expectation. This potentially allows the network to mitigate against worst-case outcomes and can also improve performance, as predicting higher moments provides a richer training signal. Rainbow (Hessel et al., 2018) combined six improvements to the original deep Q-learning algorithm, including dueling networks, distributional DQN, and noisy DQN, to improve both the training speed and the final performance on the ATARI benchmark. Policy gradients: Williams (1992) introduced the REINFORCE algorithm. The term “policy gradient method” dates to Sutton et al. (1999). Konda & Tsitsiklis (1999) introduced the actor- critic algorithm. Decreasing the variance by using different baselines is discussed in Greensmith et al. (2004) and Peters & Schaal (2008). It has since been argued that the value baseline primarily reduces the aggressiveness of the updates rather than their variance (Mei et al., 2022). Policy gradients have been adapted to produce deterministic policies (Silver et al., 2014; Lillicrap et al., 2016; Fujimoto et al., 2018). The most direct approach is to maximize over the possible actions, but if the action space is continuous, this requires an optimization procedure at each step. The deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm (Lillicrap et al., 2016) moves the policy in the direction of the gradient of the action value (implying the use of an actor-critic method). Modern policy gradients: We introduced policy gradients in terms of the parameter update. However, they can also be viewed as optimizing a surrogate loss based on importance sampling of the expected rewards, using trajectories from the current policy parameters. This view allows us to take multiple optimization steps validly. However, this can cause very large policy updates. Overstepping is a minor problem in supervised learning, as the trajectory can be corrected later. However, in RL, it affects future data collection and can be extremely destructive. Several methods have been proposed to moderate these updates. Natural policy gradients (Kakade, 2001) are based on natural gradients (Amari, 1998), which modify the descent di- rection by the Fisher information matrix. This provides a better update which is less likely to get stuck in local plateaus. However, the Fisher matrix is impractical to compute in models with many parameters. In trust-region policy optimization or TRPO (Schulman et al., 2015), the surrogate objective is maximized subject to a constraint on the KL divergence between the old and new policies. Schulman et al. (2017) propose a simpler formulation in which this KL divergence appears as a regularization term. The regularization weight is adapted based on the distance between the KL divergence and a target indicating how much we want the policy to change. Proximal policy optimization or PPO (Schulman et al., 2017) is an even simpler approach in which the loss is clipped to ensure smaller updates. Actor-critic: In the actor-critic algorithm (Konda & Tsitsiklis, 1999) described in section 19.6, the critic used a 1-step estimator. It’s also possible to use k-step estimators (in which we Draft: please send errata to udlbookmail@gmail.com. 398 19 Reinforcement learning observe k discounted rewards and approximate subsequent rewards with an estimate of the state value). As k increases, the variance of the estimate increases, but the bias decreases. Generalized advantage estimation (Schulman et al., 2016) weights together estimates from many steps and parameterizes the weighting by a single term that trades off the bias and the variance. Mnih et al. (2016) introduced asynchronous actor-critic or A3C in which multiple agents are run independently in parallel environments and update the same parameters. Both the policy and value function are updated every T time steps using a mix of k-step returns. Wang et al. (2017) introduced several methods designed to make asynchronous actor-critic more eﬀicient. Soft actor-critic (Haarnoja et al., 2018b) adds an entropy term to the cost function, which encourages exploration and reduces overfitting as the policy is encouraged to be less confident. Offline RL: In offline reinforcement learning, the policy is learned by observing the behavior of other agents, including the rewards they receive, without the ability to change the policy. It is related to imitation learning, where the goal is to copy the behavior of another agent without access to rewards (see Hussein et al., 2017). One approach is to treat offline RL in the same way as off-policy reinforcement learning. However, in practice, the distributional shift between the observed and applied policy manifests in overly optimistic estimates of the action value and poor performance (see Fujimoto et al., 2019; Kumar et al., 2019a; Agarwal et al., 2020). Conservative Q-learning (Kumar et al., 2020b) learns conservative, lower-bound estimates of the value function by regularizing the Q-values. The decision transformer (Chen et al., 2021c) is a simple approach to offline learning that takes advantage of the well-studied self-attention architecture. It can subsequently be fine-tuned with online training (Zheng et al., 2022). Reinforcement learning and chatbots: Chatbots can be trained using a technique known as reinforcement learning with human feedback or RLHF (Christiano et al., 2018; Stiennon et al., 2020). For example, InstructGPT (the forerunner of ChatGPT, Ouyang et al., 2022) starts with a standard transformer decoder model. This is then fine-tuned based on prompt-response pairs where the response was written by human annotators. During this training step, the model is optimized to predict the next word in the ground truth response. Unfortunately, such training data are expensive to produce in suﬀicient quantities to support high-quality performance. To resolve this problem, human annotators then indicate which of several model responses they prefer. These (much cheaper) data are used to train a reward model. This is a second transformer network that ingests the prompt and model response and returns a scalar indicating how good the response is. Finally, the fine-tuned chatbot model is further trained to produce high rewards using the reward model as supervision. Here, standard gradient descent cannot be used as it’s not possible to compute derivatives through the sampling procedure in the chatbot output. Hence, the model is trained with proximal policy optimization (a policy gradient method where the derivatives are tractable) to generate higher rewards. Other areas of RL: Reinforcement learning is an enormous area, which easily justifies its own book, and this literature review is extremely superficial. Other notable areas of RL that we have not discussed include model-based RL, in which the state transition probabilities and reward functions are modeled (see Moerland et al., 2023). This allows forward planning and has the advantage that the same model can be reused for different reward structures. Hybrid methods such as AlphaGo (Silver et al., 2016) and MuZero (Schrittwieser et al., 2020) have separate models for the dynamics of the states, the policy, and the value of future positions. This chapter has only discussed simple methods for exploration, like the epsilon-greedy ap- proach, noisy Q-learning, and adding an entropy term to penalize overconfident policies. In- trinsic motivation refers to methods that add rewards for exploration and thus imbue the agent with “curiosity” (see Barto, 2013; Aubret et al., 2019). Hierarchical reinforcement learning (see Pateria et al., 2021) refers to methods that break down the final objective into sub-tasks. Multi- agent reinforcement learning (see Zhang et al., 2021a) considers the case where multiple agents coexist in a shared environment. This may be in either a competitive or cooperative context.

The state transition allots half the probability to the direction the policy indicates and divides the remaining probability equally between the other valid actions. The reward function returns -2 irrespective of the action when the penguin leaves a hole. The reward function returns +3 regardless of the action when the penguin leaves the fish tile and the episode ends, so the fish tile has a value of +3.

Perhaps this success is less surprising when there are far more parameters than train- ing data. However, it’s debatable whether this is generally the case. AlexNet had ∼60 million parameters and was trained with ∼1 million data points. However, to complicate matters, each training example was augmented with 2048 transformations.

The curse of dimensionality implies that the training dataset is tiny compared to the possible inputs; if each of the 40 inputs of the MNIST-1D data were quantized into 10 possible values, there would be 1040 possible inputs, which is a factor of 1035 more than the number of training examples.

Third, generalization gets better with more parameters (figure 8.10). The model in the previous paragraph has 177,201 parameters. Assuming it can fit one training example per parameter, it has 167,201 spare degrees of freedom.

It implies that there is a large family of degenerate solutions, so there may always be a direction in which the parameters can be modified to decrease the loss. Sejnowski (2020) suggests that “. . . the degeneracy of solutions changes the nature of the problem from finding a needle in a haystack to a haystack of needles.” In practice, networks are frequently overparameterized by one or two orders of mag- nitude (figure 20.3). However, data augmentation makes it diﬀicult to make precise statements. Augmentation may increase the data by several orders of magnitude, but these are manipulations of existing examples rather than independent new data points. Moreover, figure 8.10 shows that neural networks can sometimes fit the training data well when there are the same number or fewer parameters than data points. This is presumably due to redundancy in training examples from the same underlying function. Several theoretical convergence results show that, under certain circumstances, SGD converges to a global minimum when the network is suﬀiciently overparameterized. For example, Du et al. (2019b) show that randomly initialized SGD converges to a global minimum for shallow fully connected ReLU networks with a least squares loss with enough hidden units. Similarly, Du et al.

Other results show that if the network is wide enough, local minima where the loss is higher than the global minimum are rare (see Choromanska et al., 2015; Pascanu et al., 2014; Pennington & Bahri, 2017). Kawaguchi et al. (2019) prove that as a network becomes deeper, wider, or both, the loss at local minima becomes closer to that at the global minimum for squared loss functions. These theoretical results are intriguing but usually make unrealistic assumptions about the network structure. For example, Du et al. (2019a) show that residual networks converge to zero training loss when the width of the network D (i.e., the number of hidden units) is O[I4K2] where I is the amount of training data, and K is the depth of the network.

Informally, if the minimum is flatter, then small errors in the estimated parameters are less important. This can also be motivated from various theoretical viewpoints. For example, minimum description length theory suggests models specified by fewer bits generalize better (Rissanen, 1983). For wide minima, the precision needed to store the weights is lower, so they should generalize better. Flatness can be measured by (i) the size of the connected region around the minimum for which training loss is similar (Hochreiter & Schmidhuber, 1997a), (ii) the second- order curvature around the minimum (Chaudhari et al., 2019), or (iii) the maximum loss within a neighborhood of the minimum (Keskar et al., 2017). However, caution is required; estimated flatness can be affected by trivial reparameterizations of the network due to the non-negative homogeneity property of the ReLU function (Dinh et al., 2017). Nonetheless, Keskar et al. (2017) varied the batch size and learning rate and showed that flatness correlates with generalization. Izmailov et al. (2018) average together weights from multiple points in a learning trajectory. This both results in flatter test and training surfaces at the minimum and improves generalization. Other regularization techniques can also be viewed through this lens. For example, averaging model outputs (ensembling) may also make the test loss surface flatter. Kleinberg et al. (2018) showed that large gradient variance during training helps avoid sharp regions. This may explain why reducing the batch size and adding noise helps generalization.

(2020) show that the variability of identical models trained with different seeds on corrupted data can be enormous and unpredictable. Goodfellow et al. (2015a) showed that deep learning models are susceptible to adver- sarial attacks. Consider perturbing an image that is correctly classified by the network Notebook 20.4 Adversarial attacks as “dog” so that the probability of the correct class decreases as fast as possible un- til the class flips. If this image is now classified as an airplane, you might expect the perturbed image to look like a cross between a dog and an airplane. However, in prac- tice, the perturbed image looks almost indistinguishable from the original dog image (figure 20.14).

By considering the gradients of the network output with re- spect to the input, it’s possible to find a small perturbation (center, magnified by 10 for visibility) that, when added to the original image (right), causes the network to misclassify it as an ostrich. This is despite the fact that the original and perturbed images are almost indis- tinguishable to humans. Adapted from Szegedy et al. (2014). The conclusion is that there are positions that are close to but not on the data man- ifold that are misclassified. These are known as adversarial examples. Their existence is surprising; how can such a small change to the network input make such a drastic change to the output? The best current explanation is that adversarial examples aren’t due to a lack of robustness to data from outside the training data manifold. Instead, they are exploiting a source of information that is in the training distribution but which has a small norm and is imperceptible to humans (Ilyas et al., 2019).\n",

In general, the smaller the model, the larger the proportion of weights that can be pruned without significantly damaging performance. For example, Han et al. (2016) maintained good performance for the VGG network on ImageNet classification when 8% of the weights were retained. This significantly decreases the model size but isn’t enough to show that overparameterization is not required; the VGG network has ∼100 times as many parameters as there are ImageNet training data (disregarding augmentation). Pruning is a form of architecture search. In their work on lottery tickets (see sec- tion 20.2.7), Frankle & Carbin (2019) (i) trained a network, (ii) pruned the weights with the smallest magnitudes, and (iii) retrained the remaining network from the same ini- tial weights. By iterating this procedure, they reduced the size of the VGG-19 network (originally 138 million parameters) by 98.5% on the CIFAR-10 database (60,000 exam- ples) while maintaining good performance. For ResNet-50 (25.6 million parameters), they reduced the parameters by 80% without reducing the performance on ImageNet (1.28 million examples). These demonstrations are impressive but (disregarding data augmentation) these networks are still over-parameterized after pruning.\n",

Chapter 21 Deep learning and ethics This chapter was written by Travis LaCroix and Simon J.D. Prince. AI is poised to change society for better or worse. These technologies have enormous potential for social good (Taddeo & Floridi, 2018; Tomašev et al., 2020), including im- portant roles in healthcare (Rajpurkar et al., 2022) and the fight against climate change (Rolnick et al., 2023). However, they also have the potential for misuse and unintended harm. This has led to the emergence of the field of AI ethics. The modern era of deep learning started in 2012 with AlexNet, but sustained interest in AI ethics did not follow immediately. Indeed, a workshop on fairness in machine learning was rejected from NeurIPS 2013 for want of material. It wasn’t until 2016 that AI Ethics had its “AlexNet” moment, with ProPublica’s exposé on bias in the COMPAS recidivism-prediction model (Angwin et al., 2016) and Cathy O’Neil’s book Weapons of Math Destruction (O’Neil, 2016). Interest has swelled ever since; submissions to the Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency (FAccT) have increased nearly ten-fold in the five years since its inception in 2018. In parallel, many organizations have proposed policy recommendations for responsible AI. Jobin et al. (2019) found 84 documents containing AI ethics principles, with 88% released since 2016. This proliferation of non-legislative policy agreements, which depend on voluntary, non-binding cooperation, calls into question their eﬀicacy (McNamara et al., 2018; Hagendorff, 2020; LaCroix & Mohseni, 2022). In short, AI Ethics is in its infancy, and ethical considerations are often reactive rather than proactive. This chapter considers potential harms arising from the design and use of AI systems. These include algorithmic bias, lack of explainability, data privacy violations, militariza- tion, fraud, and environmental concerns. The aim is not to provide advice on being more ethical. Instead, the goal is to express ideas and start conversations in key areas that have received attention in philosophy, political science, and the broader social sciences.\n",

      "    │   │   └──  From a purely scientific perspective, bias refers to statistical deviation from some norm. In AI, it can be pernicious when this deviation depends on illegitimate factors that impact an output. For example, gender is irrelevant to job performance, so it is illegitimate to use gender as a basis for hiring a candidate. Similarly, race is irrelevant to criminality, so it is illegitimate to use race as a feature for recidivism prediction. Bias in AI models can be introduced in various ways (Fazelpour & Danks, 2021): Draft: please send errata to udlbookmail@gmail.com. 422 21 Deep learning and ethics Figure 21.1 Structural description of the value alignment problem. a) Problems arise from a) misaligned objectives (e.g., bias) or b) informational asymmetries between a (human) principal and an (artificial) agent (e.g., lack of explainability). Adapted from LaCroix (2023). • Problem specification: Choosing a model’s goals requires a value judgment about what is important to us, which allows for the creation of biases (Fazelpour & Danks, 2021). Further biases may emerge if we fail to operationalize these choices successfully and the problem specification fails to capture our intended goals (Mitchell et al., 2021). • Data: Algorithmic bias can result when the dataset is unrepresentative or incom- plete (Danks & London, 2017). For example, the PULSE face super-resolution algorithm (Menon et al., 2020) was trained on a database of photos of predom- inantly white celebrities. When applied to a low-resolution portrait of Barack Obama, it generated a photo of a white man (Vincent, 2020). If the society in which training data are generated is structurally biased against marginalized communities, even complete and representative datasets will elicit biases (Mayson, 2018). For example, Black individuals in the US have been policed and jailed more frequently than white individuals. Hence, historical data used to train recidivism prediction models are already biased against Black communities. • Modeling and validation: Choosing a mathematical definition to measure model fairness requires a value judgment. There exist distinct but equally-intuitive defi- nitions that are logically inconsistent (Kleinberg et al., 2017; Chouldechova, 2017; Berk et al., 2017). This suggests the need to move from a purely mathemati- cal conceptualization of fairness toward a more substantive evaluation of whether algorithms promote justice in practice (Green, 2022). • Deployment: Deployed algorithms may interact with other algorithms, struc- tures, or institutions in society to create complex feedback loops that entrench ex- tant biases (O’Neil, 2016). For example, large language models like GPT3 (Brown et al., 2020) are trained on web data.

(2023) and Mehrabi et al. (2022). online, the training data for future models is degraded. This may exacerbate biases and generate novel societal harm (Falbo & LaCroix, 2022). Unfairness can be exacerbated by considerations of intersectionality; social categories can combine to create overlapping and interdependent systems of oppression. For ex- ample, the discrimination experienced by a queer woman of color is not merely the sum of the discrimination she might experience as queer, as gendered, or as racialized (Crenshaw, 1991). Within AI, Buolamwini & Gebru (2018) showed that face analysis algorithms trained primarily on lighter-skinned faces underperform for darker-skinned faces. However, they perform even worse on combinations of features such as skin color and gender than might be expected by considering those features independently. Of course, steps can be taken to ensure that data are diverse, representative, and complete. But if the society in which the training data are generated is structurally biased against marginalized communities, even completely accurate datasets will elicit biases. In light of the potential for algorithmic bias and the lack of representation in training datasets described above, it is also necessary to consider how failure rates for the outputs of these systems are likely to exacerbate discrimination against already-marginalized communities (Buolamwini & Gebru, 2018; Raji & Buolamwini, 2019; Raji et al., 2022). The resulting models may codify and entrench systems of power and oppression, including capitalism and classism; sexism, misogyny, and patriarchy; colonialism and imperialism; racism and white supremacy; ableism; and cis- and heteronormativity. A perspective on bias that maintains sensitivity to power dynamics requires accounting for historical inequities and labor conditions encoded in data (Micelli et al., 2022). To prevent this, we must actively ensure that our algorithms are fair. A naïve ap- proach is fairness through unawareness which simply removes the protected attributes (e.g., race, gender) from the input features. Unfortunately, this is ineffective; the remain- ing features can still carry information about the protected attributes. More practical approaches first define a mathematical criterion for fairness. For example, the separation measure in binary classification requires that the prediction ˆ y is conditionally indepen- dent of the protected variable a (e.g., race) given the true label y. Then they intervene in various ways to minimize the deviation from this measure (figure 21.2). Notebook 21.1 Bias mitigation A further complicating factor is that we cannot tell if an algorithm is unfair to a com- munity or take steps to avoid this unless we can establish community membership. Most research on algorithmic bias and fairness has focused on ostensibly observable features Draft: please send errata to udlbookmail@gmail.com. 424 21 Deep learning and ethics that might be present in training data (e.g., gender). However, features of marginalized communities may be unobservable, making bias mitigation even more diﬀicult. Examples include queerness (Tomasev et al., 2021), disability status, neurotype, class, and religion. A similar problem occurs when observable features have been excised from the training data to prevent models from exploiting them.\n",

However, elsewhere actions can carry moral weight. Examples include decision-making in autonomous vehi- cles (Awad et al., 2018; Evans et al., 2020), lethal autonomous weapons systems (Arkin, 2008a,b), and professional service robots for childcare, elderly care, and health care (An- derson & Anderson, 2008; Sharkey & Sharkey, 2012). As these systems become more autonomous, they may need to make moral decisions independent of human input. This leads to the notion of artificial moral agency. An artificial moral agent is an autonomous AI system capable of making moral judgments. Moral agency can be categorized in terms of increasing complexity (Moor, 2006): 1. Ethical impact agents are agents whose actions have ethical impacts. Hence, almost any technology deployed in society might count as an ethical impact agent. 2. Implicit ethical agents are ethical impact agents that include some in-built safety features. 3. Explicit ethical agents can contextually follow general moral principles or rules of ethical conduct. 4. Full ethical agents are agents with beliefs, desires, intentions, free will, and consciousness of their actions. The field of machine ethics seeks approaches to creating artificial moral agents. These approaches can be categorized as top-down, bottom-up, or hybrid (Allen et al., 2005). Top- down (theory-driven) methods directly implement and hierarchically arrange concrete rules based on some moral theory to guide ethical behavior. Asimov’s “Three Laws of Robotics” are a trivial example of this approach. In bottom-up (learning-driven) approaches, a model learns moral regularities from data without explicit programming (Wallach et al., 2008). For example, Noothigattu et al. (2018) designed a voting-based system for ethical decision-making that uses data collected from human preferences in moral dilemmas to learn social preferences; the sys- tem then summarizes and aggregates the results to render an “ethical” decision. Hybrid approaches combine top-down and bottom-up approaches. Some researchers have questioned the very idea of artificial moral agency and argued that moral agency is unnecessary for ensuring safety (van Wynsberghe & Robbins, 2019). See Cervantes et al. (2019) for a recent survey of artificial moral agency and Tolmeijer et al. (2020) for a recent survey on technical approaches to artificial moral agency.

In the absence of transparency or explainability, there is an asymmetry of information between the user and the AI system, which makes it hard to ensure value alignment. Creel (2020) characterizes transparency at several levels of granularity. Functional transparency refers to knowledge of the algorithmic functioning of the system (i.e., the logical rules that map inputs to outputs). The methods in this book are described at this level of detail. Structural transparency entails knowing how a program executes the algorithm. This can be obscured when commands written in high-level programming lan- guages are executed by machine code. Finally, run transparency requires understanding how a program was executed in a particular instance. For deep networks, this includes Problem 21.4 knowledge about the hardware, input data, training data, and interactions thereof. None of these can be ascertained by scrutinizing code. For example, GPT3 is functionally transparent; its architecture is described in Brown et al. (2020).

Deep networks may contain billions of parameters, so there is no way we can understand how they work based on examination alone. However, in some jurisdictions, the public may have a right to an explanation. Article 22 of the EU General Data Protection Regulation suggests all data subjects should have the right to “obtain an explanation of the decision reached” in cases where a decision is based solely on automated processes.1 These diﬀiculties have led to the sub-field of explainable AI. One moderately success- ful area is producing local explanations. Although we can’t explain the entire system, Notebook 21.2 Explainability we can sometimes describe how a particular input was classified. For example, Local interpretable model-agnostic explanations or LIME (Ribeiro et al., 2016) samples the model output at nearby inputs and uses these samples to construct a simpler model (figure 21.3). This provides insight into the classification decision, even if the original model is neither transparent nor explainable. It remains to be seen whether it is possible to build complex decision-making systems that are fully understandable to their users or even their creators. There is also an ongoing debate about what it means for a system to be explainable, understandable, or interpretable (Erasmus et al., 2021); there is currently no concrete definition of these concepts. See Molnar (2022) for more information. 1Whether Article 22 actually mandates such a right is debatable (see Wachter et al., 2017).

LIME probes the network at nearby points to see if it identifies these as Pr(y = 1|x) < 0.5 (cyan points) or Pr(y = 1|x) ≥0.5 (gray points). It weights these points by proximity to the point of interest (weight indicated by circle size). b) The weighted points are used to train a simpler model (here, logistic regression — a linear function passed through a sigmoid). c) Near the white cross, this approximation is close to d) the original function. Even though we did not have access to the original model, we can deduce from the parameters of this approximate model, that if we increase x1 or decrease x2, Pr(y = 1|x) will increase, and the output class will change.

Even when sensitive information is removed, auxiliary Problem 21.8 knowledge and redundant encodings can be used to de-anonymize datasets (Narayanan & Shmatikov, 2008). Indeed, this famously happened to the Governor of Massachusetts, William Weld, in 1997. After an insurance group released health records that had been stripped of obvious personal information like patient name and address, an aspiring graduate student was able to “de-anonymize” which records belonged to Governor Weld by cross-referencing with public voter rolls. Hence, privacy-first design is important for ensuring the security of individuals’ in- formation, especially when applying deep learning techniques to high-risk areas such as healthcare and finance. Differential privacy and semantic security (homomorphic en- cryption or secure multi-party computation) methods can be used to ensure data security during model training (see Mireshghallah et al., 2020; Boulemtafes et al., 2020).\n",

This leads to the view that quantitative methods are better than qualitative ones. However, as we shall see in section 21.5, purportedly objective endeavors are rarely value-free. The sociological concept of deskilling refers to the redundancy and devaluation of skills in light of automation (Braverman, 1974). For example, off-loading cognitive skills like memory onto technology may cause a decrease in our capacity to remember things. Analogously, the automation of AI in morally-loaded decision-making may lead to a decrease in our moral abilities (Vallor, 2015). For example, in the context of war, the automation of weapons systems may lead to the dehumanization of victims of war (Asaro, 2012; Heyns, 2017). Similarly, care robots in elderly-, child-, or healthcare settings may reduce our ability to care for one another (Vallor, 2011).\n",

This is because gains in wealth can offset gains in productivity by creating increased demand for products and services. In addition, new technologies can create new types of jobs. Even if automation doesn’t lead to a net loss of overall employment in the long term, new social programs may be required in the short term. Therefore, regardless of whether one is optimistic (Brynjolfsson & McAfee, 2016; Danaher, 2019), neutral (Metcalf et al., 2016; Calo, 2018; Frey, 2019), or pessimistic (Frey & Osborne, 2017) about the possibility of unemployment in light of AI, it is clear that society will be changed significantly.\n",

In this regard, smaller companies and start-ups may not be able to compete with large, established tech companies. This may give rise to a feedback loop whereby the power and wealth become increasingly concentrated in the hands of a small number of corporations. A recent study finds an increasing discrepancy between publications at major AI venues by large tech firms and “elite” universities versus mid- or lower-tier universities (Ahmed & Wahed, 2016). In many views, such a concentration of wealth and power is incompatible with just distributions in society (Rawls, 1971). This has led to calls to democratize AI by making it possible for everyone to create Problem 21.11 such systems (Li, 2018; Knight, 2018; Kratsios, 2019; Riedl, 2020). Such a process requires making deep learning technologies more widely available and easier to use via open source and open science so that more people can benefit from them.

The choice of research problem. 2. Gathering evidence related to a research problem. 3. Accepting a scientific hypothesis as an answer to a problem. 4. Applying the results of scientific research. It is perhaps uncontroversial that values play a significant role in the first and last of these stages. The initial selection of research problems and the choice of subsequent ap- plications are influenced by the interests of scientists, institutions, and funding agencies. However, the value-free ideal of science prescribes minimizing the influence of moral, personal, social, political, and cultural values on the intervening scientific process. This idea presupposes the value-neutrality thesis, which suggests that scientists can (at least in principle) attend to stages (2) and (3) without making these value judgments. However, whether intentional or not, values are embedded in machine learning re- search. Most of these values would be classed as epistemic (e.g., performance, gener- alization, building on past work, eﬀiciency, novelty). But deciding the set of values is itself a value-laden decision; few papers explicitly discuss societal need, and fewer still discuss potential negative impacts (Birhane et al., 2022b). Philosophers of science have Draft: please send errata to udlbookmail@gmail.com. 432 21 Deep learning and ethics questioned whether the value-free ideal of science is attainable or desirable. For exam- ple, Longino (1990, 1996) argues that these epistemic values are not purely epistemic. Kitcher (2011a,b) argues that scientists don’t typically care about truth itself; instead, they pursue truths relevant to their goals and interests. Machine learning depends on inductive inference and is hence prone to inductive risk. Models are only constrained at the training data points, and the curse of dimensionality means this is a tiny proportion of the input space; outputs can always be wrong, regard- less of how much data we use to train the model. It follows that choosing to accept or reject a model prediction requires a value judgment: that the risks if we are wrong in acceptance are lower than the risks if we are wrong in rejection. Hence, the use of inductive inference implies that machine learning models are deeply value-laden (Johnson, 2022). In fact, if they were not, they would have no application: it is precisely because they are value-laden that they are useful. Thus, accepting that algorithms are used for ranking, sorting, filtering, recommending, categorizing, label- ing, predicting, etc., in the real world implies that these processes will have real-world effects. As machine learning systems become increasingly commercialized and applied, they become more entrenched in the things we care about. These insights have implications for researchers who believe that algorithms are some- how more objective than human decision-makers (and, therefore, ought to replace human decision-makers in areas where we think objectivity matters).\n",

Misinformation spreads faster and persists more readily than the truth in many types of social networks (LaCroix et al., 2021; Ceylan et al., 2023).

It is also important to be aware of the potential for the misapplication of machine learning techniques.

      "    │       └──  A second positive step is to encourage diversity. When social groups are homogeneous (composed mainly of similar members) or homophilous (comprising members that tend to associate with similar others), the dominant group tends to have its conventions recapitulated and stabilized (O’Connor & Bruner, 2019). One way to mitigate systems of oppression is to ensure that diverse views are considered. This might be achieved through equity, diversity, inclusion, and accessibility initiatives (at an institutional level), participatory and community-based approaches to research (at the research level), and increased awareness of social, political, and moral issues (at an individual level). The theory of standpoint epistemology (Harding, 1986) suggests that knowledge is socially situated (i.e., depends on one’s social position in society). Homogeneity in tech circles can give rise to biased tech (Noble, 2018; Eubanks, 2018; Benjamin, 2019; Brous- sard, 2023). Lack of diversity implies that the perspectives of the individuals who create these technologies will seep into the datasets, algorithms, and code as the default perspec- tive. Broussard (2023) argues that because much technology is developed by able-bodied, white, cisgender, American men, that technology is optimized for able-bodied, white, cis- gender, American men, the perspective of whom is taken as the status quo. Ensuring technologies benefit historically marginalized communities requires researchers to under- stand the needs, wants, and perspectives of those communities (Birhane et al., 2022a).

For example, Green (2019) highlights that one project developed using AI to enhance police accountability and alternatives to incarceration and another developed to increase security through predictive policing are both advertised as “AI for Social Good.” Assigning this label is a value judgment that lacks any grounding principles; one community’s good is another’s harm. When considering the potential for emerging technologies to benefit society, it is necessary to reflect on whether those benefits will be equally or equitably distributed. It is often assumed that the most technologically advanced solution is the best one— so-called technochauvinism (Broussard, 2018). However, many social issues arise from underlying social problems and do not warrant technological solutions. Some common themes emerged throughout this chapter, and we would like to impress four key points upon the reader: 1. Research in machine learning cannot avoid ethics. Historically, researchers could focus on fundamental aspects of their work in a controlled laboratory set- Draft: please send errata to udlbookmail@gmail.com. 434 21 Deep learning and ethics ting. However, this luxury is dwindling due to the vast economic incentives to commercialize AI and the degree to which academic work is funded by industry (see Abdalla & Abdalla, 2021); even theoretical studies may have social impacts, so researchers must engage with the social and ethical dimensions of their work. 2. Even purely technical decisions can be value-laden. There is still a widely- held view that AI is fundamentally just mathematics and, therefore, it is “objec- tive,” and ethics are irrelevant. This assumption is not true when we consider the creation of AI systems or their deployment. 3. We should question the structures within which AI work takes place. Much research on AI ethics focuses on specific situations rather than questioning the larger social structures within which AI will be deployed. For example, there is considerable interest in ensuring algorithmic fairness, but it may not always be possible to instantiate conceptions of fairness, justice, or equity within extant social and political structures. Therefore, technology is inherently political. 4. Social and ethical problems don’t necessarily require technical solutions. Many potential ethical problems surrounding AI technologies are primarily social and structural, so technical innovation alone cannot solve these problems; if scien- tists are to effect positive change with new technology, they must take a political Problem 21.13 and moral position. Where does this leave the average scientist? Perhaps with the following imperative: it is necessary to reflect upon the moral and social dimensions of one’s work. This might require actively engaging those communities that are likely to be most affected by new technologies, thus cultivating relationships between researchers and communities and em- powering those communities. Likewise, it might involve engagement with the literature beyond one’s own discipline. For philosophical questions, the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy is an invaluable resource. Interdisciplinary conferences are also useful in this regard. Leading work is published at both the Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency (FAccT) and the Conference on AI and Society (AIES).\n",
